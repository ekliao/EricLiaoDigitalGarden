Language usage, including punctuation and spelling.

- etc
*et cetera* already means there are items left unsaid, so it coincides with the ellipsis. 
Don't say: `A, B, C...etc.`
Say: `A, B, C, etc.`

- cancelation | cancellation
While rules favor the spelling with a single L if it appears in an unstressed syllable (e.g. cancel), "cancellation" with double Ls is an exception and the dominant spelling in the United States. I spell it this way too.

{ #c3cbe4}

- [[The definite article "the"\|The definite article "the"]]

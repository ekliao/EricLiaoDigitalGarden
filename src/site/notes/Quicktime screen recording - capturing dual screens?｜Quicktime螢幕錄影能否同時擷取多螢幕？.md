During initial region selection, it may appear that Quicktime allows you to describe both screens for recording, but this is deceptive. The result video clearly shows that only one of the two screen was captured, not both.

Quicktime also has the "whole screen" option. Upon recording, it prompts you to choose either screen 1 or screen 2, but not both.

In conclusion, only one of two screens can be captured any given time.

實測結果：每次錄影僅能擷取一個螢幕的畫面。

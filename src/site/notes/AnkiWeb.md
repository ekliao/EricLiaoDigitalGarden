I have never really thought too much about AnkiWeb until now.

Long story short, I now notice alternatives to the free and proprietary [[Anki\|Anki]] sync service. One promising solution is [[Ankisyncd\|Ankisyncd]].

# An Anki profile (database) = an AnkiWeb account

After initial account login and verification of email at the first sync attempt, each profile is associated automatically and permanently with that email/account. This implies that one can have theoretically unlimited cloud storage by switching profiles, which is a piece of cake. Good-bye to any worry I might accidentally wipe out my main cloud with my alt and experimental profile's content. This is a huge plus for Anki in my [[Refocusing on Glossary Management\|renewed evaluation]] of the perfect online and desktop glossary tool.

# An eye-opening introduction to Heptabase

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Bn4xrshog&t=1169s). The co-creators of the YouTube channel [[Paperless Movement\|Paperless Movement]] are so excited about Heptabase that they consider it "the one tool to rule them all" (my paraphrase). Okay, they did mention using it in tandem with [[Lazy\|Lazy]], this mysterious tool, which they think will replace [[MEM.ai\|MEM.ai]].

In five minutes' frantic rapid-fire showcasing Heptabase, they have sold me on the versatility and multifaceted views of this tool. I know it is co-created by a young Taiwanese genius, [[Alan Chan 詹雨安\|Alan Chan 詹雨安]]. That makes me feel really good.

According to [[Paco Cantero\|Paco Cantero]], Heptabase:
- Distills every single note-taking app
- Simplifies it to the best
- Combines their best features
- Without overcomplicating things
# Tools that Heptabase "replaces"

- Miro
- Scrintal
- Mem
- Obsidian
- Roam (also Logseq)
- Tana (but more intuitive, per [[Thomas Rödl\|Thomas Rödl]])
- Notion
- MarginNote
- Milanote
- Evernote

Quick take by [Fred Jame](https://www.facebook.com/thefredjame/posts/pfbid0Go5JYdsUCSPCg6nUme2not4JbodUxGxxSwuPdcF4ESRPEUuk5oBLYaeBqAXaftsSl)

> 過去幾個月密集使用了Heptabase、Scrintal、Obsidian、以及原本就在用的Tana等幾個知識整理工具。
> 
> 除了Tana之外，整體功能最完備的應該是Heptabase（Obsidian透過上千種外掛可以更完備，但會變得很複雜、學習曲線很陡、而且不利於在行動裝置上使用）。
> 
> 但不知道為什麼，Heptabase用起來有一點太「厚重」的感覺，整體介面雖然不醜，但沒有Scrintal或Notion那麼精巧俐落。

# Desiderata

- No web publishing option (à la Obsidian, Logseq, Notion). Workaround: Sharing a whiteboard and everything in it (cards).

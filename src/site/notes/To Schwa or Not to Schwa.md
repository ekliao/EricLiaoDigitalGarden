*([[Note on the SAMPA phonetic transcription\|Note on the SAMPA phonetic transcription]])*

A Hong Kong Chinese blogger about English dictionaries and grammar whose views I often dismiss as too dogmatic points out how the first syllable of `occasion` being only /@/, not ever /O/ or /oU/. I occasionally do /oU/ and thought it a systematic option. Before I chalked this off as yet another uninformed post, I looked it up and it turns out I was wrong. None of the reputable English-to-English dictionaries (about 10+ of them) list /oU/ as an alternative. Well, this is perhaps the reason I have not unfollowed him.

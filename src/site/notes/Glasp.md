A competitor to [[Readwise Reader\|Readwise Reader]] but free!

Below is my first attempt to copy-and-paste a [Glasp](https://glasp.co/) highlight of a page from Wikipedia.

## Quick verdict
Super neat with the following metadata:
- title
- URL
- tags

But missing one thing: my "page comment" (*Unambiguous distinction...*) isn't copied, so I had to manually do a second copy-and-paste. How could they have missed this?

### Highlights & Notes

> Unambiguous distinction between "(clause) predicate" and "predicative (expression)", both nouns.
- A predicative expression (or just predicative) is part of a clause predicate, and is an expression that typically follows a copula or linking verb, e.g. be, seem, appear, or that appears as a second complement of a certain type of verb, e.g. call, make, name, etc.[1] The most frequently acknowledged types of predicative expressions are predicative adjectives (also predicate adjectives) and predicative nominals (also predicate nominals). The main trait of all predicative expressions is that they serve to express a property that is assigned to a "subject", whereby this subject is usually the clause subject

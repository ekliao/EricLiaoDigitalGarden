I am annoyed that the capital I and the lowercase l usually look the same (despite minute differences, if any) in many san serif fonts, which are more elegant and modern.

One unfortunate consequence of preferring san serif while needing to tell these two symbols apart led me to consistently use the numeral 1 to represent the capital I in [[SAMPA\|SAMPA]], for the short i sound in English, e.g. /b1t/ instead of /bIt/. This means I can't use "1" for the minor narrow-transcription sound of /l1vd/ for *lived*. This conflation of /1/ and /I/ is all over the place in my [[Anki\|Anki]] notes where I have lots of SAMPA transcriptions.

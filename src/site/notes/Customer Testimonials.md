- Hi Eric,  
I just read through your email, and I wanted to start by saying thank you. The organizer (our client) is ___ , and they do sometimes get overwhelmed with participants attending. They have them register online to get a "head count", but they often have last minute add ons, or people who attend without registering at all. Since it is a public setting for the county, they must provide for anyone attending. They do some of their events online, so that is never a problem with the equipment, but I think they were underprepared for this one, since 6 interpreters were to attend, to cover a variety of languages. 

I very much appreciate your forethought to bring your own headsets, I am sure the quality of the interpretation for the Mandarin-speaking participant was 100X better using the equipment than it would have been whispering. Your professionalism and care you brought to this assignment is much appreciated and will not go unnoticed.
  
Thank you for taking the time to provide us feedback and giving the best service possible despite the circumstances. I definitely look forward to working with you again in the future!

## Found a ginormous dictionary 速譯通 that edges out the previous winner 金山詞霸

I just found a free online dictionary that boasts of 7 million unique terms, larger than the 3-million-term 金山詞霸 (Jinshanciba) I knew to be the largest collection. The 7 million figure came from a Google search when I tried to find out the size of 金山詞霸:

Q: 金山词典, 海词在线词典, 速译通在线词典哪个词汇量更大?

A: 收录（汉英、英汉）词条：  
金山：20万    
海词：500多万    
速译通：700万

Here, the answer of 20万 (200,000) for 金山詞霸 is clearly mistaken (could be a typo for 200万 or 2,000,000). But the 7 million for 速譯通 grabbed my eyes. How can it not? I quickly looked for this rather copycat-sounding uninspired name and was surprised it's available as an online search tool, reportedly since 2010:

The proof is in the pudding. So I tried to search for one technical term, which came up in an online conference I interpreted for:
#### box culvert

速譯通's results:

函渠,箱形涵洞,箱形暗渠,盒形排水渠,盒形暗渠,方形去水渠,方形排水渠,方形暗渠
```

So, it gives 8 distinct Chinese terms. (Kudos to it for not listing duplicates!)

In comparison, the 3+ million 金山詞霸 gave the following results:
```
♦《簡明英漢詞典》♦ 函渠, 箱形涵洞  
  
♦《英漢航海大詞典》♦ n.箱涵,矩形涵洞  
  
♦《名詞委審定-英漢公路科技名詞(1997)》♦ 箱涵  
  
♦《名詞委審定-英漢鐵道科技名詞(1997)》♦ 箱涵

♦《現代英漢綜合大辭典》♦ 函渠, 箱形涵洞

♦《漢英航海大詞典》♦ 矩形涵洞

♦《漢英航海大詞典》♦ 箱涵    
 
♦《名詞委審定-漢英鐵道科技名詞(1997)》♦ 箱涵 
  
♦《名詞委審定-漢英公路科技名詞(1997)》♦ 箱涵
```
The highly duplicative results from myriad sources come down to just 4 distinct Chinese terms:
```
箱涵, 函渠, 箱形涵洞, 矩形涵洞
```
out of which two (箱涵, 矩形涵洞) aren't offered by 速譯通. 

So, by consulting both 速譯通 and 金山詞霸, one can get 10 distinct Chinese translations for `box culvert`. This is mind-blowing! 速譯通's 8 is especially impressive and this single anecdotal data point seems to support its claim of 7 million versus 金山詞霸's 3.

To play the demanding critic, I wish 速譯通 would contain those two missing terms. That would make it the undisputed one-stop shop.
### 海詞 may be the second place?

So, if 7 million is likely true, how about the claimed 5 million for 海詞? That would be the second place if true. I will keep my eyes peeled for further information.

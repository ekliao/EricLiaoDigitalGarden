# At a glance

- Unified design: everything is a node
- AirTable + ?
- An outlining app rather than writing app like Obsidian
- Supertags
- Cloud
- $10/month or $100 a year
- Still in beta, not a full publicly available commercial product
- Norwegian

#PKM 
# Web publishing

Tana's web publishing works only through "workspace." Too much remains to be seen. I won't give up the current free and working Obsidian publishing solution for something this unknown.

### Which Is The Best? Tana or Obsidian?

#### Highlights & Notes
- Publish to web I’ve shared my digital garden online using Obsidian almost since the beginning. At first, I used Obsidian Publish and then started to experiment with different options, finally settling on the Digital Garden plugin.  I deleted my WordPress website and replaced it with my digital garden. It’s easy to update, even on my iPhone, a cinch to add new content and lends itself to writing.  Tana has an option to publish a workspace. I think this is to facilitate sharing templates at the moment rather than a full blown publication solution.

- Notion, AirTable
- Backlinks
- Outliner
- Nodes (hierarchical)
- Semantic structure through Supertags
	- Define something however you like
- Tana templates (a bunch of fields)
	- Like creating applets or databases for anything
	- Sharable
- Long ways to go to improve UI
- AI
	- AI field
		e.g. AI-suggested action items based on YOUR content
		e.g. AI giving you critique of a plan
	- System of commands ("Tana Commands")
- Command nodes
	- Ask AI
	- API
		- Webhooks
			- Whatsapp
			- Telegram
		- Automation / handshakes with other apps
- Ecosystem (long-term goal)
	- Integration
	- Plugins
	- API
- Input API
	- e.g. let GPT do some magic/coding for you, given sample data, like airline iteneraries
	- AI for app builders
		- LangChain
- Onboarding is a challenge for new users not familiar with workflows
- Likely freemium model
- AI is expensive

## Tana Paste

Markdown-like input text into Tana structures.

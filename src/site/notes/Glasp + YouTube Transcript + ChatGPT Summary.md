Title: "(118) Make invoicing and project management a breeze with LSP.expert - WEBINAR - YouTube" Transcript: "hello hello everyone and welcome to this Tech forward insiders webinar make invoicing and project management a breeze with lsp.expert and I'm so excited about this one because I don't know about you but I really really hate taxes and the financial side of work and so having a tool that streamlines and simplifies these things makes my life easier and I hope that you'll find by the end of this webinar that there's a great tool out there that will make your lives easier as well let me just start with some quick housekeeping I see you're all starting to introduce yourself so go ahead and say hi in the chat hello to everyone I'm Josh Goldsmith The Geek in Chief over at Tech forward which is all about empowering language professionals like you translators interpreters and other language professionals to embrace technology to learn about the chain Changing Times and to streamline their lives right and I see that some of you are writing in so hello to everyone joining us live the Insiders joining us live on Zoom other people joining us live on YouTube if you're an Insider hop into Zoom so that we make sure we see your questions we'll do our best to answer questions from everyone but we will give preference to the Insiders there and also a big hello to everyone watching the replay it's so exciting to see that people are joining from all over from Lima Peru Santa Rosa California Memphis Hong Kong Alabama Canada um Washington DC Norway and other places so a very big welcome to you this webinar will be about sure we don't miss them and please feel free to share highlights or screenshots on social media only me and and Sophie will be visible on the screen and speaking of which we've got a special guest today hi I'm Sophie hi everyone how are you doing it's so great to have you here and Sophie is part of the lsp. expert we'll talk about the stuff you need to do yeah on the business side of your business so creating jobs setting up your services and your languages and fuzzy matches labels filters and stuff like that um we'll also talk about time tracking and expenses and Q a please do keep those questions coming throughout the session we'll be answering them as we go and now a quick poll what do you use for invoicing or project management so your options are a word or Excel be an invoicing tool for small businesses like QuickBooks freshbooks Zoho and the like see LSP expert D related to invoicing billing or project management into the chat as we go along and in the meantime I'll say that some of the reasons why I think you probably need an invoicing or project management tool R for tracking all of your projects payments and expenses for quickly firing off invoices or quotes to clients when they're asking how much would you charge for this project you want to send them something that looks professional with your logo on it with all the information and you want it to be quick which is why I'm a was complaining about exactly the same things as I was doing so I started exploring my options and looked into lsv expert and other tools but the other tools were either or at the same time too too complicated or too expensive so I quickly chose LSP and then never turned back um just because the the thing I love the most about that is that it allows me to invoice all of my clients at the end of the month in just like two minutes which is the best thing ever in the world yeah and you're not alone when I first started off those invoices and quotes in any language you want and what I really like about this tool usually I'm on the lookout for tools that are not just designed once and then parked in a corner somewhere but tools that are constantly being updated based on feedback from users and that is the case with LSP expert if you click this link I'm just gonna pop it in the chat for anybody who's curious if you click this link you'll see hundreds and hundreds of updates that have been made to the tool over the years which I think is great um we changed our detailed forms so that we can in the future hopefully near future um match other software like tax filling accounting softwares Etc as some of you mentioned um things about governments and everything in Europe it's moving quite fast many governments are changing things around accounting and we are trying to keep up with the game knowing that we just have just one it guys are doing our best um we also updated our price calculations and hierarchies so that you could easily create jobs that would be we're going to fill okay that was fast Julie urban planning English to Spanish I'm going to say it's a translation for now translation English to Spanish perfect so I'm not going to ask you the name of your client Julie I'm just going to type Julie's client as an example so we'll click the plus button right here and you'll type the name of your client here you could put in contact information if you wanted that's optional and then you can type in the start date and the end date so and random and this is translation and our language pair so I don't have the language pair in here yet so I'll just hit plus and we're going to go from English into Spanish how will we be sorry to interpret you if there is a language we don't have on the list you just send us an email and we'll add it as quick as we can awesome how will we be billing let's just say we're building this one in words for now and this project is 2579 words why not and then under billing we've got a few different options per unit with a fixed questions at that point oops I keep clicking all the wrong things today in three minutes all right everyone welcome back so hope words or days or something else and there can be other units if it's not on the list you can just click the plus button to add the unit that you want and the same thing applies for domains I believe if they're not on the list you can add them right answer fee yes before the domains you'll have to add them in your settings so let's go look at how we add them in our settings so over here when you log in uh well when you look at the sidebar you'll see your name and when you click on it you can go to add it to the list so what is missing from this list what kind of services might be missing translation proofreading interpreting anyways let's just say I also have a medical interpreting service that I wanted to add here I could do it that way I could ah transcription thank you transcription thank you very much and voice over and yes mileage sure so you saw I just added all three of those services in as as fast as I could type them basically language pairs yeah again so in the services if there is ever a service you don't offer things that you're doing if it's mileage is going to be miles and you charge per mile well I've just added miles as a potential unit so that I can fill that in later and there are other things down here so hours for example is when you do time tracking that one is automatically set up by default and we'll see how that works in just a second I think that's everything I wanted to show people for this step uh prices right you can set prices for specific types of clients for example suppliers did that go first of all I saw a question from somebody how do I add services so let me just show you one more time how you do that so when you are on any other page like the jobs page right here you see your name click there and go to settings and from there your services are under system values right here so how did it go I see some of you saying this is very easy to use you're enjoying setting things up so far it went well I'm glad to hear that yosura wonderful good so we will just keep moving right all right you can't change the time once you've created this wow okay so we'll add a new one yeah for accountability reasons so that you can just change the length of time but the the start time you cannot change all right so I just yeah I started at nine o'clock and I did two hours of work and so now you can see I've already made four hundred dollars from this project not too bad very easy to turn on the time tracking the important thing to remember is to set it up as a project where you're billing by the amount of time but just so you know it's possible and then you can fire It Off by hitting send there are even the options to pick from your different languages that you've set up right here so if you want it to go off in French well there it is it's automatically updated the text of the email so it'll be in French based on the template that I created and you can see it's attached right here if I don't want to set it up to send the invoices through the system I can also just generate a PDF and here it is joshgoldsmith.com I can set it up so I can do that as well I can also send a partial invoice part way through a project and I can track which ones are paid but I think and Sophie's absolute favorite point is the one at the very bottom of this list which is that you could send all your invoices at the end of the month in one click yes you just have to select all the jobs you want to invoice and then you click on invoice or Loop jobs and it creates as many invoices as you have clients and then you can check each and every invoice uh did that go did you manage to tweak your invoicing settings maybe add your logo add your address and send off a an invoice or at least generate an invoice go ahead and share some thoughts in the chat I know and Sophie was answering questions right now that's why you're just joining us now so um wonderful now why don't you answer that question out loud on Sophie so a question was about the purpose of a group of jobs yeah so um what's interesting with the group of jobs is that basically if you have meaning which jobs you have to do quite quickly and also which clients you have to call to say hi maybe you forgot to date me so that's how you can keep track of what has been invoiced paid and everything and you can create um labels about that or you can also uh choose to I don't know filter those information and you have all the information you need about your invoices again on your left side bar on the invoices section you can click there and you have a list of all your invoices right now Josh's are just created but Belgium it's important um and so that I can filter them depending on their labels I use it also for jobs in my personal jobs uh just if I have a highly confidential job it helps me pin it out and know exactly how I need to work with that one because I cannot have the data in the same places I have other data so that's the kind of thing that can be really useful super easy to set up and that's the same for the filters so you can see that you have by default some filter is in your jobs view you can add as many filters if as do that whenever I get a new client I create a new filter for that client so that I can know each and every time I get connected to my account that I need to work for that client now and I have this for my clients I can have it for my groups of jobs so right now it's non-eu or EU and I can filter by label just choosing to see only my EU clients for example which can be nice when I need to do my final year accounting um and to see how I need to invoice those people yeah and I I think we forgot to show people uh the dashboard it's optional and then you can have the amount without taxes and add your taxes taxes are some things you can set up also in your settings you just click on ADD I'll cancel because I don't need it and then it appears in your list okay and depending on where you're clicking you're gonna have all the details on the right side of the screen so for example right now I bought a new chair last year I have attached my invoice so that it's never lost anywhere and I know that it has been paid the tax I paid on it and many words do I translate per hour if I'm working for this particular client or if I'm doing legal translation well you can track all of that stuff in the reporting Tab and you can see your taxes there too so I think we've just got yeah now we don't have an image here do you want to quickly show people what that looks like and then we'll start wrapping up the reporting you mean yeah sure so you just go to that it's the last line um of your sidebar you click on it and you have a whole list of a bunch of analysis files with your calendar for keeping track of which jobs are due when um and with your cloud storage tools as well and we're at the end of our webinar and we're going to answer just a few more questions that came in at the last minute and Sophie has been answering them in the chat as we went along I think there's one question about overriding browser localization settings yes when you create your account uh you you are asked if you want to overwrite your settings the idea is that your localization settings what the theme um and create your jobs and then it populates um into the tool but then you might have to do a bit of keeping up um just to make sure that you don't have double surfaces and things like that um so yeah I'm a big fan of just preparing everything and then going but you can go either way um and if you need to change the numbers of your invoices because um some in some countries you just have to have the same structure for all your invoices from number one in others you can change depending on your clients and happy to answer and and I'll just add that the support documentation is really really good it's just pages and Pages explaining how to do everything so I think any question you get more than once ends up being a support document that's the idea so um you have a few more webinars coming up right and so if people want to learn more yeah they are not uh programmed yet but we should have one about Outsourcing and one about tips and tricks like how to set up your filters and use labels uh the best way you can and other little covering and if not just pop by check in let me know how it's going so tha"

(03:16) expert team and I've known her for a long time now um yeah why don't you tell us in two or three sentences Who You Are uh okay so three sentences maybe hi I'm Anthony I'm an English and Spanish into French creative and literary translator um I mostly translate marketing and literary content uh usually non-fiction but still literary um and I'm also a yoga teacher I give conferences about time management um and also I'm an ambassador for LSP expert uh and this is the reason why I'm here with you today wonderful and I'm so
(03:54) excited to have you here you've actually spoken at some tech forward events in the past but this is the first time we've had you for a live webinar so let's dive in um as everyone will know uh you got this link in the email I sent out before but if you haven't done so yet please just go ahead and set up a free 30-day trial with LSP expert I've just popped the link in the chat this is come completely free afterwards if you like it you can decide to sign up for an account and there's even a special discount for
(04:29) everyone joining us here today that you'll hear about at the end of the session this is an affiliate link so if you do sign up with this link we'll get a little credit on the tech forward side as um for letting you know about this tool but we only recommend tools we love okay whoops no poll yet first what we will cover so um we'll give you an introduction to lsp.
(04:53) expert we'll talk about the stuff you need to do yeah on the business side of your business so creating jobs setting up your services and your languages and fuzzy matches labels filters and stuff like that um we'll also talk about time tracking and expenses and Q a please do keep those questions coming throughout the session we'll be answering them as we go and now a quick poll what do you use for invoicing or project management so your options are a word or Excel be an invoicing tool for small businesses like QuickBooks freshbooks Zoho and the like see LSP expert D
(05:44) another tool for translators or interpreters something like translation office 3000 there are others out there as well or e um I don't know no do I keep track of my invoicing in my project management so just go ahead and type your answer into the chat all right so some people are using tools for translators or interpreters uh including the pros.
(06:12) com invoicing system some are using invoicing tools for small businesses like xero I didn't put that on the list but that's another one um just a quick reminder if you want everyone to read your messages on Zoom change that setting from host and panelists to everyone some of you do use official tools that are required in your countries that's also necessary for invoicing in some cases and some of you are using Word and Excel I hope by the end of this session we can convince you that there are a lot of really good reasons not to use word or Excel for
(06:47) invoicing including all these great reports and yes you might be using something like PayPal for sending invoices but it can be more helpful to track all of your projects and have reports and the really cool thing as far as I'm concerned is that this tool is designed by translators for translators so so you can have all of the stuff you need fuzzy matches uh you can have things for your travel time if you're an interpreter but we'll get to that later okay so let's dive in I think it's um feel free to type any challenges
(07:21) related to invoicing billing or project management into the chat as we go along and in the meantime I'll say that some of the reasons why I think you probably need an invoicing or project management tool R for tracking all of your projects payments and expenses for quickly firing off invoices or quotes to clients when they're asking how much would you charge for this project you want to send them something that looks professional with your logo on it with all the information and you want it to be quick which is why I'm a
(08:02) big fan of having a tool that makes this quick for you it can also be helpful for outsourcing for tracking time and for looking at reports which give you an overview of where things stand how much money did I make this month how much money did I make last month am I making enough money to pay my bills what am I going to have to pay in taxes this year we'll talk about all of that later but in the meantime I'd like to ask and Sophie to tell us how you got into LSP expert how you became an ambassador why
(08:38) did you pick this tool why exactly well thanks for that question um honestly it's just because I was completely lost as a translator so I started my business I think seven or eight years ago um and I just started it off with an Excel sheet but I got lost quite quickly meaning that for the first couple of months or maybe three or four months I just had like one client two clients uh for whom to work at the same time and then it started expanding and I started not knowing exactly for whom I had to work that week doing what exactly how
(09:17) much I needed to get paid I was getting confused with my rates because they dependent on my clients um and I I really had a hard time creating nice invoices it sounds stupid but if you want to look professional you need professional tools and invoices and quotes are part of that um so I was just complaining about that to a colleague of mine another Belgian girl and she told me well I use this tool it's quite new it's called LSP expert and it's been created by a translator and her husband because she
(09:52) was complaining about exactly the same things as I was doing so I started exploring my options and looked into lsv expert and other tools but the other tools were either or at the same time too too complicated or too expensive so I quickly chose LSP and then never turned back um just because the the thing I love the most about that is that it allows me to invoice all of my clients at the end of the month in just like two minutes which is the best thing ever in the world yeah and you're not alone when I first started
(10:33) out I was doing the Excel sheets things too and I see other people here are saying well they're in the same bulb and they're they're facing the same kinds of problems and that's normal don't worry um but the good news is there are some tools that can help you out so let's do start with a quick overview of LSP expert yep so this my screen share is loading there we go I can see it so this is what you'll see when you go to the lsp.
(11:08) expert home page it says helping translators get things done helping you to improve your productivity with effort effortless project and client management creating invoices and quotes Outsourcing jobs and more some basic information for you LSP expert was founded in 2016 by the translator and uh techie that you were just telling us about the computer programmer it's now got over 600 users and it's run by translators which I think is great and I'll say translators many times but of course all of the things that we're talking about are
(11:47) useful for interpreters too and I know a lot of interpreters also work in Translation so I think you'll find many places where this is useful for you if you are an interpreter as well LSP expert is web-based it's not a piece of software that you download to your device and it has all these great features like language pairs fuzzy matches setting your services setting your languages which other commercially available tools might not have the interface itself is available in either English or French you get to pick but you can also fire
(12:25) off those invoices and quotes in any language you want and what I really like about this tool usually I'm on the lookout for tools that are not just designed once and then parked in a corner somewhere but tools that are constantly being updated based on feedback from users and that is the case with LSP expert if you click this link I'm just gonna pop it in the chat for anybody who's curious if you click this link you'll see hundreds and hundreds of updates that have been made to the tool over the years which I think is great
(13:01) it's something that really reflects what we need and the newest version 2.0 was released in February 2023 which is just a few months ago which is why I thought this was the perfect time to have an Sophie here for this webinar and Sophie you want to tell us in a minute or two what's in the 2.0 okay yeah maybe yeah the team first there's the team uh so it's just the four of us so the co-creators of LSB expert are gaholin who's the translator and Cedric whom we call the I.T guy because why not
(13:35) um and then they started it out together thinking about the design what they needed uh to have us features Etc so that he created a basic tool that became LSP expert I know we are the second version uh based on all the feedback we got from colleagues knowing that most of the team is or was a translator so Caroline is still a translator I'm still a translator and evalina who's our productivity specialist and marketing girl uh she was a translator and she's just stopped because she wanted to go to
(14:09) the productivity side of life um but we are still translating and still on the business and translation is still our main business uh so yeah we are the first two users of it and the first people changing it and in the new version we changed maybe small things for most people but that were really important to us um we have a new user interface that we find um more I I will say clearer uh and simpler to use even simpler um we split the services and language fairs they worked together before but we noticed it wasn't that practical
(14:50) um we changed our detailed forms so that we can in the future hopefully near future um match other software like tax filling accounting softwares Etc as some of you mentioned um things about governments and everything in Europe it's moving quite fast many governments are changing things around accounting and we are trying to keep up with the game knowing that we just have just one it guys are doing our best um we also updated our price calculations and hierarchies so that you could easily create jobs that would be
(15:29) um invoiced at the right rates depending on your specialization language combination and client profile and we added bulk actions and team features for people who start working at small teams but also for bigger teams and that's just the start of it yeah and tons more exactly and the pricing because I know people are curious about this so you all get a free 30-day trial but afterwards there are different price plans depending on the number of clients you have and if you run a team of translators and interpreters and you do some Outsourcing
(16:09) then you have those options as well so we've just put that on the screen these are the current prices not the time of recording which is April 20 23. I'm saying this now because we've I've been running webinars for years now and sometimes things do change I do okay let's see how you actually use this tool let's see if it's as easy as we are promising so we're just going to create a job by now everyone probably has set up their free trial and when you log in right in the upper right hand corner let
(16:46) me go slightly bigger you have the option to click here and add a job so we're going to do just that and when you add a job you see you'll start filling in information about this job this project so I'm going to call this a job um Can somebody in the chat tell me what kind of job I'm doing what language combination what specialization so we'll fill it in with actual information that reflects maybe a job that you're working on right now I'll keep my eyes on the chat and in the meantime I'll tell you
(17:21) we're going to fill okay that was fast Julie urban planning English to Spanish I'm going to say it's a translation for now translation English to Spanish perfect so I'm not going to ask you the name of your client Julie I'm just going to type Julie's client as an example so we'll click the plus button right here and you'll type the name of your client here you could put in contact information if you wanted that's optional and then you can type in the start date and the end date so and
(18:01) Sophie was saying oh it's so hard for me to keep track of what I have to do when let's say this and we're starting it immediately and it's going to be due I don't know next Thursday by the end of the day so you can click start of the day end of the day you can set these times how you want or you can go in and say well let's make it actually seven well let's make it 1 pm one o'clock P.
(18:29) M optionally you can pick the domain that you're working in some of these come pre-configured and when you set up your free trial you might have also added some more information here and for your services and language pairs as well we'll talk about labels later you could add them here type of service so this you can see I've already got some of my services in here some mostly interpreting related services but let's just call this translation whoops what did I do oh I didn't I hit enter so it's safe so yeah we'll just go back and
(19:07) finish it sorry I got ahead of myself by everything yes now we can go in and actually make some edits but I'm just going to walk you back to starting from scratch because you didn't mean to get you lost and I hit the wrong button so let's do it again urban planning translation to English to Spanish now we'll probably see some of these things already appearing here right we already typed in Julie's client so we don't have to do it again this we're going to say it's due on the 5th I'm just picking stuff at
(19:42) random and this is translation and our language pair so I don't have the language pair in here yet so I'll just hit plus and we're going to go from English into Spanish how will we be sorry to interpret you if there is a language we don't have on the list you just send us an email and we'll add it as quick as we can awesome how will we be billing let's just say we're building this one in words for now and this project is 2579 words why not and then under billing we've got a few different options per unit with a fixed
(20:23) price so if you're charging 500 for the entire package you just type in 500 there you can also do time based invoicing where you've there's a time tracker built into the tool we'll show you that in a second or if it's non-billable then you'd Mark non-billable but we'll just say per unit currency is euros and we can add the job did I miss anything I don't think so we're good to go you're bad okay so I have created this job I haven't yet added the price that I'm charging for this job but I've created
(20:57) the job and I would just change the pricing stuff over here so let's imagine that I'm charging 25 cents a word I could add discounts or charges or a minimum fee I hit save and voila it will calculate this project uh how much I'm going to earn for this project right here and so I think that's it that's all we got to do to create a job and the nice thing is that now your computer remembers that you have a new client that is called Julie's client that you have a price set up for that client in that combination without a
(21:36) specific specialization and you can start working on your job right away so let's try it um it's time for our interactive exercise so it is your turn to create a job using lsp.expert you'll have three minutes I'm going to hit the play button right here to start the timer and Sophie and I are going to turn off our cameras and mute ourselves and everybody take a stab at it try to create a job and then we'll report back and you can let us know how it was and we'll answer your first round of
(22:08) questions at that point oops I keep clicking all the wrong things today in three minutes all right everyone welcome back so hope
(25:27) that went well go ahead and pop your initial reactions into the chat how did it go any challenges you faced anything that was especially easy or especially surprising or something that really is nice for translators and interpreters in the tool go ahead and share your first thoughts there and in the meantime I think we can probably answer one question uh I was just going to show the answer to that question uh that about currency and Sophie so that's right here if I'm not mistaken right yeah I can see it so hedwig's
(26:09) asking hi I created my account in Souls pen but it creates a job in Euros how do I change the currency so when you create the job you just have a drop down list of currencies you can select from and again it's like for the language if you don't have it you send us an email and we'll add it as soon as we can so that's how right here on my screen you're seeing if I wanted to change the currency I could change it to Solace or I can change it back and yes hedweek you can set a default currency and that's
(26:42) exactly where we're going right now you are that's a perfect lead in to where we are going so want to show you now so um let me just answer some of these questions before we do that since these are specifically about what we were just looking at so is there an option for words instead of hours for quantity yes when you set this up you pick the way that you are going to be invoicing so this one's by unit here I'll show you when we're starting with a um a new job so add a job and right here under unit that's where you would pick
(27:31) words or days or something else and there can be other units if it's not on the list you can just click the plus button to add the unit that you want and the same thing applies for domains I believe if they're not on the list you can add them right answer fee yes before the domains you'll have to add them in your settings so let's go look at how we add them in our settings so over here when you log in uh well when you look at the sidebar you'll see your name and when you click on it you can go to
(28:10) settings right here and that's where we are going to change quite a few of the default settings where we can set up our services our languages hello to that lovely furball over there and Sophie that's better and she has a little brother Maurice and he might make an appearance too so sorry cool so here we are in the settings menu again clicking your name and going to settings and then you can see you can set up for example your company we'll get to that in the third interactive exercise we've got planned for you but also the system
(28:49) values is the first place where we are going to start because that's where we can add our services language pairs units matches that's for translation tools domains of expertise and so on so because somebody was asking about domains of expertise I'll just jump there right now domains of expertise add a new domain of expertise education was the one that yosra was asking about and now it will appear on the list and setting up other things is pretty much the same it's that easy so these are the
(29:23) services that I have you can see I set some up for interpreting so I have interpreting a basic fee I sometimes have a travel time fee that I charge I might have travel expenses that I can charge but I've also got translation and proofreading and I had legal translation as a service but now I could just put translation and domain if I wanted I could write legal there and so that's your services if there's a service that you offer that is not on the list you just click add a new service and we'll
(29:55) add it to the list so what is missing from this list what kind of services might be missing translation proofreading interpreting anyways let's just say I also have a medical interpreting service that I wanted to add here I could do it that way I could ah transcription thank you transcription thank you very much and voice over and yes mileage sure so you saw I just added all three of those services in as as fast as I could type them basically language pairs yeah again so in the services if there is ever a service you don't offer
(30:43) anymore but you should you don't want to delete it completely because you have some reports and interesting data about that service you can disable it and if you have a favorite service like the one you offer all the time like interpretation for Josh you can pin it so that whenever you create a job it will be the first uh proposition that appears uh if you have never worked for that client if you have already worked for that client the first uh preposition that will appear is the last kind of service you provided to that client
(31:14) so there we go I no longer have an increased per diem that was only for one specific client that I no longer work for so I just disabled it and my service I want to appear right at the top of the list is interpretation so I just went to pin of course I can unpin it or repin it to favorite it or put it at the top of the list language pairs you can see I've got the language pairs that I've already created jobs for so I didn't have English to Spanish on my list of language pairs before but since we created the job with
(31:46) English to Spanish it automatically went in here as one of our language pairs but let's say I also do French hello French to English at and for interpreting purposes you could say well let's say I do German to English both ways then we could add that right there and then it appears with these two arrows indicating that it goes both ways and the same thing is the case we can pin or disable right here for our services units well what units do you work in everybody prices their services differently right perhaps one of the
(32:37) things that you're doing if it's mileage is going to be miles and you charge per mile well I've just added miles as a potential unit so that I can fill that in later and there are other things down here so hours for example is when you do time tracking that one is automatically set up by default and we'll see how that works in just a second I think that's everything I wanted to show people for this step uh prices right you can set prices for specific types of clients for example suppliers
(33:16) and clients so if we want to set a specific price let's say what do we just add right my transcription price is in hours and it's going to be for all my language pairs we'll say and I charge I don't know 100 euros I already have one that's 100 let's say 150 Euros an hour great price uh why not I'll add that right there so I could optionally put in language pair and domain if I pick those things for a job then it's automatically going to pop that in but here we go I've just set up
(33:53) a new price right there transcription 150 per hour and I left the domain blank so I think that's all we wanted to show people and now it's time to dive in and give it a try yeah so for this exercise so if you didn't set up a job before you can do that now but otherwise basically we would like to encourage you to add just one service not all of your services but just one service one unit and one price and then see if you can create a job using that service unit and price so again three minutes we'll
(34:34) continue answering some of your questions in writing as you go but three minutes to try this out I'm going to turn off my camera and mute myself I'll see you back here in three minutes all right everyone welcome back so how
(37:35) did that go first of all I saw a question from somebody how do I add services so let me just show you one more time how you do that so when you are on any other page like the jobs page right here you see your name click there and go to settings and from there your services are under system values right here so how did it go I see some of you saying this is very easy to use you're enjoying setting things up so far it went well I'm glad to hear that yosura wonderful good so we will just keep moving right
(38:19) along because there's plenty more to cover so we've added some Services we've added some units some prices and now we wanted to mention that you can track your time which is great if you charge by the hour and that can be something that you're doing for proofreading for example or it could be the case for interpreting we just had a question from Victor saying he starts at a specific time and ends at a specific time how do I put that information in there and that's all built right into the time tracking so
(38:55) we're not going to do an exercise about this but I'm just going to show you what it looks like so if I were to create a job time tracked job we're not going to worry about any of this stuff right now we'll just say it's proofreading English to English and it's in hours and then I pick invoicing type time based invoicing so that the time I log will be used to generate the pricing I'll just pop in a price this is a really great project I'm getting paid 200 Euros an hour for this
(39:29) one and then I would go to time tracking and let's say I could just start tracking my time right now I click the button when I'm done I'll stop tracking my time and you can see it says currently running 640 and there it is it appears not very much time because it was just a quick demo I can also go in and add time so let's say I worked on this project this morning for two hours all of a sudden it's right here on my invoice the time that I did and it says I did this at 640 I actually did that this morning
(40:16) all right you can't change the time once you've created this wow okay so we'll add a new one yeah for accountability reasons so that you can just change the length of time but the the start time you cannot change all right so I just yeah I started at nine o'clock and I did two hours of work and so now you can see I've already made four hundred dollars from this project not too bad very easy to turn on the time tracking the important thing to remember is to set it up as a project where you're billing by the amount of time
(40:56) that you log yes and it's calculated minute by minute so that is quite precise you don't have second Precision but minutes is already good enough you're right this wasn't a very good example let's say that I worked for three minutes so now it says 203 total and you can see that this has updated to reflect those three minutes all right so we've set up everything we've launched a job and now it's time to create an invoice for this project I just did so I'm just going to go over to invoices
(41:30) and click create invoice it's not rocket science and there we go it created an invoice with a number it's for my demo client I didn't fill in any information about that client yet status is created I could update that later we'll talk about that in a second when it's issued and then there's the information Time Track job proofreading English 200 Euros an hour I make a lot of money proofreading two hours and 2.
(41:59) 05 hours and there it is and you can see you can add taxes discounts so on and so forth and what's really cool is that we can send an email with this if we do that we can actually pick the client from the list I don't have any right now it'll have Auto populated text which you can set I want all of my emails to be this format that I've written you write it once and it's there for you you can even add some variables so it'll fill in their name and so on we don't have time to talk about that today
(42:28) but just so you know it's possible and then you can fire It Off by hitting send there are even the options to pick from your different languages that you've set up right here so if you want it to go off in French well there it is it's automatically updated the text of the email so it'll be in French based on the template that I created and you can see it's attached right here if I don't want to set it up to send the invoices through the system I can also just generate a PDF and here it is
(43:07) that's fine but it doesn't have all the information I need on it I need my business address for example so I put in my logo already but I'm going to need my business address and my vat number and so on for those invoices I sent where do you think that is well it's right over here under settings again again nice and easy and you'll just pop in the information for your company so first line of address imaginary zip code City optionally adding this information and depending on your country you're going
(43:46) to see that right below you have v18 number tax ID something like that depending on your country if you're in France for example it's going to put number because that's the way they do things there but um you can well it'll be defined automatically depending on the country um you're working from I hit save and now if I regenerate that invoice which one were we doing today time tracked job there we go if I were to generate the invoice it now has that information right there on the invoice and you can even pick
(44:32) from lots of different templates for invoices we won't go into this today but there are different ways that you can set it up yes to match your colors maybe and you can also add your terms and conditions inside of your invoices and quotes or as an attachment and you can send it from your Gmail account from your Outlook account or you can hook it up with your professional email that you've got through SMTP that's a little more complicated than what we're talking about today but basically if I want to send it from Josh
(45:04) joshgoldsmith.com I can set it up so I can do that as well I can also send a partial invoice part way through a project and I can track which ones are paid but I think and Sophie's absolute favorite point is the one at the very bottom of this list which is that you could send all your invoices at the end of the month in one click yes you just have to select all the jobs you want to invoice and then you click on invoice or Loop jobs and it creates as many invoices as you have clients and then you can check each and every invoice uh
(45:40) it's super easy so for example yeah right now this one has been invoiced so I'm not sure it's going to work but all right we'll leave that one off Okay so we've selected them and then we would just go down to info voice them all it's right here right yeah up up right yeah action actions thanks everything is in the actions button create invoices even you can create also partial invoices and right now it's creating just one because it's for that one client but if you had had to invoice
(46:10) like three clients it would pop up little window with the three lines of well one line per invoice per client and then you can go into each of those invoices all right so enough of us talking it's your turn to try this out so we'll give you another three minutes to set up uh your invoices again that's under settings so the same place we were looking before down here pick your name settings my company you can upload your logo I did that before we started and then you can fill in this information right here and
(46:49) then you just go to that sample job you had and you can click it invoices and create your invoice if you haven't already done so so three minutes to play around with setting up your invoices and sending an invoice off you go enjoy as much as one can enjoy invoicing anyways I mean it's nice when the invoices are actually painted that you can send them off very quickly see you in three all right everyone welcome back so how
(50:17) did that go did you manage to tweak your invoicing settings maybe add your logo add your address and send off a an invoice or at least generate an invoice go ahead and share some thoughts in the chat I know and Sophie was answering questions right now that's why you're just joining us now so um wonderful now why don't you answer that question out loud on Sophie so a question was about the purpose of a group of jobs yeah so um what's interesting with the group of jobs is that basically if you have
(50:59) several services to provide to the same client let's say you need to translate a text then proofread it then you do a q a at the end you can group those actions into one project so basically group is a synonym for project um so that's the idea of the groups of jobs and some people would rather have a group view of what they have to do than task by task I'm a task girl but some people like to see their big projects uh without too many details so that's how it works and how it could be useful to
(51:36) you and I realized we didn't really talk about adding multiple lines multiple services to a project but that's just as easy it's just as simple as going in and adding another line so in the interest of telling you about the really cool features for translators I think we will jump ahead and I'm going to turn it over to Ann Sophie to tell you about tracking payments fuzzy matches and all sorts of fun stuff like this so many things you can do uh okay let me just pop down this okay so track your
(52:07) payments basically whenever you sorry created an invoice either you send it through LSP expert system uh directly or you just download the PDF and send it to your client you can mark your job as finished or not and your invoice as paid or pending and you'll get an alert so I don't know if you've noticed but on the left sidebar you have like a little um what's the name of it in English it's not a clock it's yeah this is a little bell a bell thank you losing my English here which will tell you what is late
(52:42) meaning which jobs you have to do quite quickly and also which clients you have to call to say hi maybe you forgot to date me so that's how you can keep track of what has been invoiced paid and everything and you can create um labels about that or you can also uh choose to I don't know filter those information and you have all the information you need about your invoices again on your left side bar on the invoices section you can click there and you have a list of all your invoices right now Josh's are just created but
(53:20) you could say that they're having paid or canceled etc etc how you can keep track of that and if you need to send a reminder you can also do it so that's a nice touch all right now now the really fun part because it matches so fuzzy matches the idea is that if you work with fuzzy matches and things like that you can totally do that it's just when you create the prices for your jobs you have to add a step defining basically which kind of categories you need to appear on your invoice and how you want to calculate your jobs and how
(53:58) those categories will match the categories in your cat tool so for example I use trados if you use it you know that there are so many categories of of matches but I decided to work just with three which are new fuzzy and perfect and I I told LSP expert that those categories correspond to Define categories in my cat tool and right now I have to do after I defined those prices and categories is just import um an analysis of the cat tool and automatically LSD expert will calculate for me which are how many new words I
(54:38) have how many fuzzies how many perfects Etc and I can change it by clients I can create different cat tool profiles so that I can work with different clients and all sources and the labels I love the labels uh so those are just like little um things little pieces of information you add to your clients your jobs your invoices your quotes Etc and it looks just like that so you will have a little rectangle of color with some text in it for example I personally use it to Define if a client is from the EU or not because of accounting purposes in
(55:20) Belgium it's important um and so that I can filter them depending on their labels I use it also for jobs in my personal jobs uh just if I have a highly confidential job it helps me pin it out and know exactly how I need to work with that one because I cannot have the data in the same places I have other data so that's the kind of thing that can be really useful super easy to set up and that's the same for the filters so you can see that you have by default some filter is in your jobs view you can add as many filters if as
(55:58) you want sorry so I have some four jobs I need to invoice jobs that are late uh jobs that I have outsourced etc etc this is something you can add in your settings and if you need to change a filter right away you can go up on the bar on the upper side of your screen and you can see that right now in your view there is one filter applied you can click on the button and change it if you want so why don't you show us an actual example from your LSP expert just bring a share your screen and show us how you've got some filters and labels and
(56:33) set up okay I just have one for now let me just share this uh yeah I need to just change my page sorry I can't do that because I have my thingy here and again okay now you can see my screen right yes perfect so in the jobs you can see that I right now I'm in my current jobs meaning the jobs that are not done yet okay so so working on it I can also have a category right here with the jobs to invoice which includes only the finished jobs and if I want to change the filter I go up there on the other side of the
(57:16) screen and I can filter by name client service so it's also etc etc but also by label if I want which is quite nice by due date delivery dates etc etc so you can see that you have a whole category of filters integrated I can apply that filter or if I want again change it so let's say I need all the pending jobs I apply two filters and now I don't have anything because there is no job corresponding to that filter but I could have that and I can also save the filter super quickly to create a new one so I
(57:51) do that whenever I get a new client I create a new filter for that client so that I can know each and every time I get connected to my account that I need to work for that client now and I have this for my clients I can have it for my groups of jobs so right now it's non-eu or EU and I can filter by label just choosing to see only my EU clients for example which can be nice when I need to do my final year accounting um and to see how I need to invoice those people yeah and I I think we forgot to show people uh the dashboard
(58:29) where you can see what's coming up this week what's due when uh so excited telling you about how to create jobs that we didn't tell you that you can actually just click there and see what is do when or what has been finished yes so that's the current jobs and you can save filters depending on what you want to see and you can also pin job so you can see that the first one right here is in yellow yeah um so that it indicates that I have just been that job and that's the one I'm working on right now I can unpin it and
(59:01) change the dates and right now um it's I mean you can see that I have pen jobs and later jobs and today which is quite important and before some things that are late maybe and you can have this setup or you can also have a layout that um just says you have to do this job for that day that date and that date so you can have a date view instead of a later or pins view you can change that in the settings too yeah I think that's it and while we're talking about all this stuff you can keep track of why don't you quickly show
(59:39) people the expenses tab as well yes yeah of course because what would be accounting without expenses because we get money and we need to get it out of course so you have seen your invoices and you also have a category with your expenses uh super quickly uh how does it work you just add an expense so everything you need to do something it's up right always you can just click on it and create it so you add a name you can have labels again which is quite useful um a date due date you can mark it as paid or not you can add the payment data
(1:00:14) it's optional and then you can have the amount without taxes and add your taxes taxes are some things you can set up also in your settings you just click on ADD I'll cancel because I don't need it and then it appears in your list okay and depending on where you're clicking you're gonna have all the details on the right side of the screen so for example right now I bought a new chair last year I have attached my invoice so that it's never lost anywhere and I know that it has been paid the tax I paid on it and
(1:00:47) the amount it cost me and I can add some notes so that I can remember what it was exactly and that's it I cannot archive my expenses also so if I want to just see the expenses of this year and I can filter them again just like I did with my jobs or my clients okay so that's our Whistle Stop tour of LSP expert I know that there's more stuff in there to play with so if for example setting all of your taxes trying to generate a quote for a client and tons more we didn't have time to go through all of it today but we hope
(1:01:24) we've given you a good idea of what you can do using this tool one last thing we've got to talk about is reporting because this is the whole point of a tool like this right how much did I invoice this month am I going to make enough money to cover my expenses this month I didn't make very much money this month is June always a slow month well you can look back at the report from June of last year and see how much money you made maybe you always make less at certain times of the year and then you
(1:01:58) can plan based on that to make sure that you're going to cover your expenses for the whole year which clients are most profitable get rid of the clock I mean that's perhaps a bit blunt but phase out the clients that you're making less money from and move towards the clients that you're making more money from if you're focused on money if you're focusing on the pleasure you derive from a project make sure you're making enough money from that project to make ends meet how much do I make how
(1:02:31) many words do I translate per hour if I'm working for this particular client or if I'm doing legal translation well you can track all of that stuff in the reporting Tab and you can see your taxes there too so I think we've just got yeah now we don't have an image here do you want to quickly show people what that looks like and then we'll start wrapping up the reporting you mean yeah sure so you just go to that it's the last line um of your sidebar you click on it and you have a whole list of a bunch of
(1:03:03) reports you can check out uh I personally use the monthly sales um almost each and every day to say how my monthly sales evolve if you work with various currencies which is my case you can show all the currencies at the same time or just currency by currency you can have details right there and you can just um download it if you want so everything you can just download and get this information to your content if you want which is quite nice um I really like also the sales by services so that I know which service
(1:03:39) has been the most interesting for me and it could be again this year last month quarterly um the sales by client as just was saying to phase out maybe some clients and also if you track your time even if you don't get paid by the hour you can track your time and know exactly how much time you spend on which kind of tasks that helps me set up my calendar much better when I have new clients and new projects and you of course also have your expenses quantity and jobs by supplier if you tend to Outsource a bit
(1:04:16) of your jobs your list of expenses and your exchange rates loss gain which is nice when you work with various currencies basically that says those are my favorites but you could check them out all of them they're all interesting to make sure that your business is sustainable and that you're not just draining out for nothing awesome so we are well I did want to just briefly tell you vet LSP expert we didn't talk about this there's too much to cover but it integrates with all sorts of tools so with your cat tools for importing those
(1:04:56) analysis files with your calendar for keeping track of which jobs are due when um and with your cloud storage tools as well and we're at the end of our webinar and we're going to answer just a few more questions that came in at the last minute and Sophie has been answering them in the chat as we went along I think there's one question about overriding browser localization settings yes when you create your account uh you you are asked if you want to overwrite your settings the idea is that your localization settings what the
(1:05:31) localization settings of your browser will help us know how you write numbers dates hours and things like that so we automatically import that from your browser if you want to override it because let's say you're using your browser in American English but you are a french-speaking person well you can do it that's why I do basically because I tend to write my numbers the French way um and not the American way but I use my browser in American so I can override it and if you forgot to do it or if you did
(1:06:04) it and want to change it you can go again to your settings and change that up and one more question for you and Sophie yes what do you recommend when I start using this tool I've been working with other tools for a while uh it's April right now if I want to start have this entire tax year which starts in January should I go back in and add all of my stuff um what about the numbering for the invoicing so what is your recommendation if you're just switching to this tool now okay so what I did personally is
(1:06:38) that I created a big invoice for each month I had worked before using LSP expert or each year depending on the quantity of data I have so that I had all the data in my system but then I took some time to create a whole list of my services create my clients profiles to make sure that I would send them the documents in their own language and then create my rates so that everything was set up first but there is another school that likes doing things on the go um so that you could also just create your jobs and then yeah that's Josh's
(1:07:15) theme um and create your jobs and then it populates um into the tool but then you might have to do a bit of keeping up um just to make sure that you don't have double surfaces and things like that um so yeah I'm a big fan of just preparing everything and then going but you can go either way um and if you need to change the numbers of your invoices because um some in some countries you just have to have the same structure for all your invoices from number one in others you can change depending on your clients and
(1:07:50) and everything you can of course edit the number of your invoice so you just open your invoice and click on edit that's the first thing you you're gonna see and change the name um of your invoice and that's it and then it's gonna increment automatically but you can change it again if you want again don't get lost in numbering your invoices uh but you can do it yes awesome so thank you for sharing those tips we are a little bit over the hour mark so it's time to wrap up right here uh but I did want to tell you about this
(1:08:27) special offer the LSP expert team is very generously offering to members of the tech forward Community if you sign up for a new yearly subscription both of those words are important so if you already have been using lsp.expert for years well sorry this is not this special offer does not apply but thanks for being awesome all right and this is for yearly subscriptions but you can take 30 off your new subscription with the code tfw30 and that's after your free 30-day trial so you don't have to pay anything
(1:09:02) for 30 days you can test it out you can see if it works uh the people who are asking questions I'm not sure how to put my services in go in play with it see how you want to to use it and if it works for you and if it does then you can sign up and if you have any question we're always there so we are based in Belgium uh two of us are parents so don't have that much time but we we try and be as available as we can so feel free to ask any question by email or through the chat um in there directly we're more than
(1:09:34) happy to answer and and I'll just add that the support documentation is really really good it's just pages and Pages explaining how to do everything so I think any question you get more than once ends up being a support document that's the idea so um you have a few more webinars coming up right and so if people want to learn more yeah they are not uh programmed yet but we should have one about Outsourcing and one about tips and tricks like how to set up your filters and use labels uh the best way you can and other little
(1:10:09) things we didn't touch on today cool and those will be in English and French and French always yeah yes and we also speak I mean in the team we have as a Carolyn speaks Dutch we all speak English and I speak Spanish too so if you need we have at the very least four languages and can manage maybe more a very multilingual team for very multilingual users so thank you so much and Sophie for joining us today thank you um I really appreciate your telling people about LSP expert and I hope people enjoyed seeing

About a week ago, I stumbled upon this Obsidian theme called Everforest and switched to it on a lark, in keeping up with the spirit of preparing for an upcoming conference about forests and human rights. I ended up being so smitten with it a week later, something I'd not imagine for a million years. I would always choose a color scheme that's crisp, sharp, high contrast. Yet, this low-contrast, green-based, warm theme has begotten that warm fuzzy feeling in me. The theme is going to stay as the look and feel of my website indefinitely, until something comes along to win my favor through serendipity. Let's see how long that'll take.

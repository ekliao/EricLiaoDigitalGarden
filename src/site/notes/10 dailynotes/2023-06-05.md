# A delight beyond comparison

The fact this is the third short blogpost about one software tool says how enthusiastic about it.

In preparing for a conference, I just dragged and dropped a Word doc (.docx) into [[Beyond Compare\|Beyond Compare]], and voil√†, it readily converted it into text and diffed it with the previous version of Word doc. I then tried PDF, and it works the same way. What a delightful surprise!

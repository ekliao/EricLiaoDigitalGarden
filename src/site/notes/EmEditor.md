I have renewed unmitigated respect for EmEditor, a powerful editor that handles large text files with ease and grace. I am talking about a 500MB text file with 3.2 million lines and it still sorted it and deleted duplicates in it in a few seconds. In comparison, [[CotEditor\|CotEditor]] on Mac, despite my delight in discovering its support for Unicode script/code block regex like `\p{Han}`, can't even handle one quarter of that (800K lines) without hanging indefinitely. It's such a pity that EmEditor, my favorite text editor bar none since I found it in 2000s, is Windows-only.

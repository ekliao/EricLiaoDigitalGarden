As shown in the picture below, what a life saver this is! It even supports the native Evernote .enex export format. How come I didn't know this this earlier? Glad I did, and I immediately changed tack to using ENEX-based solution over HTML: [[Evernote termination and exodus 「永遠」筆記(Evernote)不再永遠\|Evernote termination and exodus 「永遠」筆記(Evernote)不再永遠]]

Obsidian 的開發社群實在太強了！

# vs. [[YARLE (Yet another rope ladder from Evernote) - imports from Evernte .EMEX into various tools\|YARLE]]

The only thing YARLE does better is that it also adds the creation date metadata in the original Evernote notes. So, use YARLE over Importer for Evernote .enex whenever possible.

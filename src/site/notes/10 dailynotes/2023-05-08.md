- ## Note-taking
#note-taking 
Interest in note-taking has come on strong and ~~looks to stay~~ seems like it is going to stay for a while. #phrase/better
{ #67b816}


The reading app **Matter** is better than glasp in supporting mobile platforms, but unfortunately not a [Freemium](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freemium): It costs $3/month.

	- On a mobile device, one can highlight in place.
	- Social networking: follow or be followed
	
Q: How does Matter compare to Readwise Reader in price and functionality?

##### Page Comment

- First we need to parse this correctly.
1. IT SEEMS LIKE \[clause\]
2. NOT: \[v-ing phrase("going to school")] SEEMS LIKE "is a punishment", where "is" is wrong.

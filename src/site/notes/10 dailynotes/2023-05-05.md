- After yesterday's Anki-Obsidian migration of 25,000 notes, I am starting to feel the sluggishness. The constant progress bar for loading, indexing and searching is irksome. Search is the most impacted.

On a positive note, there are people reporting vaults with 80k, 100k, even 280k files/notes. The 280k guy reported unbearable slowness. At the 100k level, OB seems still usable. But this means I should not even entertain migrating all of Anki's read-only notes, which constitutes the bulk.

An insight offered: use a different tool for search, such as [[DEVONthink\|DEVONthink]].

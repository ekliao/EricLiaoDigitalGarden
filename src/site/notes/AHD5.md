The American Heritage Dictionary, 5th Edition.

This is one of my two go-to dictionaries, the other being Merriam-Webster's.

#grammar 
- discuss
>_v.intr._
**1.** To speak with another or others about something: _As we discussed yesterday, the problem could have more than one solution._
**2.** To examine or consider a subject in speech or writing.
**3.** To come to an agreement as a result of a discussion: _As we discussed, you will clean your room before going out._

A colleague just said `We will discuss on <topic>.` in an open communication. This made me do a double take and reached for [[Eudic 歐路詞典\|Eudic 歐路詞典]] in curiosity. I'm relieved that no, one does not say `discuss on sth`.

But here's an unintended discovery: I found these intransitive senses for `discuss` most peculiar. Interestingly, no other dictionaries have such a treatment.

For 1 and 3, I suspect the object is implicit in `as` (I forgot the proper terminology for this usage. Relative something...). If that's the case, `discuss` is still transitive. 

For 2, I would like to see an example.

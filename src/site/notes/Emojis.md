Cf. [Emoticon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emoticon)

Honestly, I hate this gradual and accelerated dumbing down of textual communication, but since verbal communication has always come before written in history and the majority of face-to-face verbal communication involves non-verbal cues such as a frown or an eye-roll, I might as well join the crowd.

On Mac, `cmd-ctrl-space` to bring up the emoji menu. ðŸ¤—

On Windows: `Win-.`

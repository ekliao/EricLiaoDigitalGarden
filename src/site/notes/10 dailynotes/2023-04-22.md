- What is a *[certified translation](https://www.atanet.org/client-assistance/what-is-a-certified-translation/)* (United States)?
I often get asked to provide certified translation.

- I upgraded my [Beyond Compare](https://www.scootersoftware.com/index.php) 3 to version 4 Standard for Mac, because I saw no reason for the Pro license. I started using it on Windows long ago, but now I use [[MacOS\|MacOS]] almost exclusively. On the Mac, BC is buggy in at least one place: the show left/right side newer or orphan view doesn't seem to work, so I have to use the more general "show change" view instead. That said, this is a must-have tool for keeping one's mind sane. Anyone who has duplicated data would agree, and that means everyone. :-)

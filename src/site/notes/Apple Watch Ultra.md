# Hello, Apple Watch Ultra!

A big and stylish upgrade. Whether size matters may be debatable; at least the battery size matters a lot to me, and I truly enjoy the bigger watch face, on which the on-screen keyboard typing is finally usable and surprisingly good.

I had used for a few years hand-me-down 40mm Apple Watches, whose battery always came under strain and wouldn't last a full-day's interpretation work. I had to bring a portable power bank with the special watch charger disk with me. This is the main reason for the upgrade.

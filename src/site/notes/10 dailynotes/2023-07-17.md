# Logseq: First actual use. I'm lovin' it!

See this picture. On the top 3 bullet points (blocks in Logseq lingo), I was still playing with the idea of parent/child hierarchy, and adding "intra-block" line breaks (by SHIFT-ENTER). I also tested block reference by name.

Then, having watched Bas's videos and taken notes in Obsidian partly from Glasp, I decided to give Logseq a try. I replicated my notes from memory, and the results were beautiful: the notes in outline form are so neat. Everything is either a parent or child or a sibling. I already know markdown. That helped a lot. The "bullet threads" plugin Bas introduced, which I installed immediately, is great.

I am smitten! Don't think I'll stop Obsidian just yet, or if at all, but Logseq with its block/outliner DNA is now officially in my PKM arsenal!

# Never-ending ambivalence between one headword per entry and one source per entry

Years ago I decided to merge millions of 金山詞霸 entries around the headword in the interest of reducing the total number of entries for Anki. This is generally the right design approach. But over recent weeks I discovered several factors that go against it. The key issues are the lack of a consistent and robust database schema and my inability to to automate in code. This makes it hard to come up with a workflow for updating such merged entries.

With this realization, combined with the decision that I've given up on Obsidian, Logseq, Tana and \<insert-the-latest-hyped PKM systems\> as my glossary system and decided to go back to the oldest Anki given its web interface's speed, I am so relieved to find that I still have a copy of the pre-merged 金山詞霸. This make it possible to gradually add selected sources into my main Anki profile. No need to reverse the prior merge. Glad I didn't rashly scrap the original format.

The moral of the story: Always save a copy of data of a given format.

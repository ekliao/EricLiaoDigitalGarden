## EmEditor
{ #81cbb4}


[EmEditor](https://www.emeditor.com/) remains my favorite text editor, not just one of, but the no. 1 for me. Unfortunately it lives only on [[Windows\|Windows]].

## Sublime Text
I make do with [[Sublime Text\|Sublime Text]] on [[MacOS\|MacOS]] but its interface seems lame especially for [[Regex\|Regex]] search and replace.

## CotEditor
Two days ago (2/23/23) I found [[CotEditor\|CotEditor]]. I had briefly tried it and uninstalled it because I didn't look hard enough to find out it has much better [[Regex\|Regex]] support than [[Sublime Text\|Sublime Text]]. It recognizes, *drum rolls please*, ``\p{Han}`` for [[Chinese characters\|Chinese characters]]!

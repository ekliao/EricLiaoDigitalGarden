- Attending week 2 of two interpreting courses as student. How I enjoy 觀摩ing (*observing and emulating* is the my best-effort translation) peer instructors in the same or similar didactic situation! It informs me on my own competency in that capacity more than the value the class materials bring me, not that I don't also enjoy the stimulation of interpretation practice during and off class.

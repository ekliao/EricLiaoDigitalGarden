Honestly, I hate this gradual and accelerated dumbing down of textual communication, but since verbal communication has always come before written in history and the majority of face-to-face verbal communication involves non-verbal cues such as a frown or an eye-roll, I might as well join the crowd.

On Mac, `CTRL-CMD-space` to bring up the emoji menu. It is part of what's officially called "Character Viewer." ðŸ¤—
- ðŸ˜­ *(2023-05-21)* Issue: This shortcut *often* fails on Nuphy Air75 Mac mode. 
	- Exploratory fix:
	    - Quickly switch to WIN keyboard mode and back. And re-activate 2.4GHz wireless connection by `FN+4`. 
	    - `CMD+space` to bring up Spotlight Search bar then `ESC`, and the emoji map may magically appears. 

On Windows: `Win-.` 
- This works instantly.

## Remember Evernote?
{ #07f371}


Manually regex-massaged and migrated to Obsidian my first #Evernote note: the long list of [[OED - A list of abbreviations,labels\|abbreviations and labels in OED]]. I needed to look up the meaning of `ppl` in the definition of `affectate`. The label means `participial`. Duh!

In regexing, my appreciation for markdown grew appreciably because of the complexity in syntax. For instance, dealing with 

`<html-tag> ... </html-tag>` 

is inherently more taxing than, say, 

`**[text]**`

For one thing, the opening and closing delimiters are exactly the same form in markdown in this case. 

But I am over-simplifying too much. I shouldn't be implying that markdown does not allow nesting, the primary source of the messiness and fundamental incompatibility between regex and html.

- [WhatsApp正式推出“分身模式”　用户可同时登入4部手机](https://www.orientaldaily.com.my/news/tech/2023/04/25/561995?fbclid=IwAR1yUiGrkc6VHeVPidyQiqevC2a0qfpE7HcO9T_SAZPuY0Go4FYAX7zcJnY&mibextid=ykz3hl)
THis makes [WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/) better than [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) now for me.

It's 2023, not anymore 1990s, when Unicode emerged heading towards its eventual domination over entire web content, driving out legacy encodings.

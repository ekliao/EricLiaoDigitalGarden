A space repetition system like Anki with a modern design.

# First impression
- Nice look
- Markdown for the win
- Hangs or freezes easily even at only 30K cards. A terrible sign of poor development.

# Use

As a medium for converting Anki HTML into markdown for Obsidian. Handles around 50K cards at a time. Slow and hangs easily.

# Quick verdict: 1 stars

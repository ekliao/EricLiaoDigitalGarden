As if to usher in the new year, I finally took the plunge, said goodbye to $6 (thanks to my teacher's discount), and subscribed to one month of Obsidian Sync! The experience is a world apart from iCloud sync, which sucks big time. I have suffered in silence for as long as I have Obsidian, but no more. When something is this flawed, I've gotta make a clean break. The peace of mind I immediately felt from the reliable software performance is worth the extra few dollars a month. Clearly I am looking to convert to an annual subscription to enjoy an additional discount.

Eventually, the annual cost would be: $8/month x 12 x (1 - 0.4) = $57.6/year. Not bad!

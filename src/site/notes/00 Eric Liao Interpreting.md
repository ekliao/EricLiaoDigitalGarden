# Eric Liao Interpreting 中英文會議/法庭口譯

## About Me

My name is Eric Liao and I go by Eric. I am a [professionally-trained](https://www.middlebury.edu/institute/academics/degree-programs/translation-interpretation) freelance conference interpreter, a state-certified court interpreter (CA/NJ/AZ/WY), and an [ATA-credentialed](https://www.atanet.org/member-center/credentialed-interpreter-designation/) interpreter. I am based in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States but [[VRI\|VRI/RSI]] enables working for any event anywhere. I am originally from Taipei, Taiwan. 

Here's my [CV/résumé](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2w2NirxGCWH6FfUQIGFDNAa1wWMs3oS/view?usp=sharing) or if you prefer it in [Word](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSfvw_oGpZYrjDhLmePZDfkx-2DQbcLdtMUTyIZMV40/edit?usp=sharing) *(last updated: Jan 16, 2023.)* 

I interpret between Mandarin Chinese *(native)* and English *(near-native)*, and also from [[Taigi\|Tâigí]].

## Welcome! 

Welcome to my digital garden! It's a collection of notes in various stages of maturity and polish, open to the world, FWIW. Created April 16, 2023, it is still nascent but an exciting start. 千里之行，始於足下。 (*A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.*) Read [[This digital garden's raison d'être\|this digital garden's raison d'être]].

### Interpretation Fees/Rates

See this reference [rate schedule](https://www.theprotranslation.com/en/chinese-translation-interpretation-transcription-service-fees/) for an idea of professional interpreters' fees. Mine are close but not the same; I quote each case independently by a number of factors. Please ask me directly for a closer quote based on information you provide about a job.

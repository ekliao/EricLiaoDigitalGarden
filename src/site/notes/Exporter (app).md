A free app for the Mac that exports all Apple Notes.app notes to markdown or HTML in one go, preserving folder structures and keeping PDF and images. No handwriting or other elements/attachments.

After selecting a target directory of the export, the file format seems to default to markdown, not HTML. Good! I happen to want .md.

The directory structure from root is like this:
- Failed Exports (contains failed notes in html)
- iCloud


<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/apple-notes-disinteroperability/#exporter-app-for-export" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



## Exporter app for Export

Turns out this is also one of the note that the [[Exporter (app)\|Exporter (app)]] app reports being unable to export to .md in its en masse export.

The overall fail rate is 1% (12 out of 1063) in my first experiment.

This export of 1000 notes took about 30 minutes. A bit slow.

## Pros
- Markdown
- Preserves folder structure
- Saves pictures and PDFs
- Optional appendage of a note's creation date to the file name
- Optional markdown header/metadata in the file
- Attachments and pictures are saved in the same folder as the note embedding them.

## Cons
- Speed (half an hour per 1000 notes)

This is a meta-dictionary app and my no. 1 go-to tool for all read-only dictionaries and other language reference materials for English, Chinese, [[Taigi\|Taigi]], and occasionally French.
## Desiderata

- I use it on my iOS devices, where each installation is free of charge after the onetime payment, but is unfortunately a separate instance (with a different collection of dictionaries and configuration) because the app isn't the "install once and sync everywhere" kind.

- The desktop version also requires a separate purchase, albeit still inexpensive. I really wish there were sync capability across all devices.

# Mac version - purchased
## Adding/removing custom dictionaries (main benefit)
### Path/director to custom dictionaries

### Caution: use only the app to manage custom dictionaries
#### *(2024-02-15)* Don't delete files directly from this directory
Deleting files would cause errors in app later when you "delete properly" from the app.
#### Don't add directly to this directory
*Don't just drop the mdx, mdd (if available), and css files (if available) to this path* either. It won't work (no effect except creating bloat). Instead, drag and drop the files (multiple files are okay; it will ask you if you want to apply the same preferences to all files) into the app's 管理 interface, to the area indicated here:

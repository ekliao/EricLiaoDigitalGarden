# Read-it-later apps as a mindset shift

[Clip](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxgTn1xElqiG59T6hAIczhPjh_5YsmU0-C?si=ZBBatEj34UZqUqa5)

Glad to learn of this free read-it-later app that could be a [[Readwise Reader\|Readwise Reader]] killer! :-)

每當有免費的開源軟體出現，和知名的定期付費軟體競爭，就該給它應得的關注。

After creating an account, I proceeded to install the [[Obsidian plugin - Omnivore\|Obsidian plugin - Omnivore]] and hit a snag right away; had to repeat several times before Obsidian was willing to install and enable the plugin. The early difficulty didn't inspire confidence. Hope this doesn't augur more trouble to come.
# Glasp killer too?

If Omnivore works as advertised, it will have a much stronger integration with Obsidian that I won't need or want to use [[Glasp\|Glasp]] again.
# Pros

- Free
- Integration with Obsidian
- Chrome extension
- iOS
- Text-to-speech with ultra realistic voice
# Text-to-speech voice

It's unthinkable how this free read-it-later app's text2speech voice is eating Readwise Reader's lunch.

To give Readwise some credit: it has moving highlighting of the words as it reads.

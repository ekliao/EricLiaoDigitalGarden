# Mid-2014 MacBook Pro

</div>



I have two of these, one being abandoned into my ownership by an ex-employer. They are great, but are long in the tooth. I am waiting with bated breath the rumored M3 15- or 16-inch MacBook Pro or Max to be available, hopefully by year end. In the meantime, I have to keep squeezing the last bit of juice out of these old power horses, especially in video downsampling and downsizing. Why would a one-hour iPad screen recording have a monstrous size of close to 10GB?

Short for "[regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)." "RegExp" is another common abbreviation.

## Perl and Regex: a match made in heaven
I am not exaggerating if I say that my career as a localization engineer (2002â€“2020) was launched entirely by my fascination with and self-taught expertise in [Perl](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and regex.

## Unicode
- [Scripts, blocks, etc.](https://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html)

The Unicode property shorthand ``\p{Han}`` is a great discovery about regex. So glad that [[CotEditor\|CotEditor]] on [[MacOS\|MacOS]] supports it, so does [[EmEditor\|EmEditor]] ([[Windows\|Windows]] only).

## People
- [Jeffrey Friedl](http://regex.info/) wrote the seminal book on regex: *Mastering Regular Expressions*.
- [Jan Goyvaerts](https://www.just-great-software.com/aboutjg.html) maintains [this](https://www.regular-expressions.info/) great educational site. He makes such esoteric topic as [Regex lookarounds](https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html) palatable.

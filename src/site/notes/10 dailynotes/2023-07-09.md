# Debugging Perl 6 books while learning

#### Spotted confusing errors from the "parsing" book

## Errata

* *(2023-07-09)* The following factual errors are very unfortunate when I am trying to unravel this whitespace tangle. 

If the predefined `<ws>` construct is equivalent in code as
```
regex ws { <!ww> \s*}
```
then clearly it matches **zero to many** different whitespace characters unless it's **within a word**. The two fatal errors are: =="at least one"== and =="unless it's at a word boundary"==.

#### Even more shocking errors from the "learning" book

## Errata
* *(2023-07-09)* After spotting two bad errors regarding `<ws>` in the [[book - Parsing With Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars, 2017, Moritz Lenz, Apress\|book - Parsing With Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars, 2017, Moritz Lenz, Apress]] book, I tried to look for and expected clarity in guidance from this book. Instead, I found what appears to be more confusing errors and terribly imprecise misused language.

First, `<|wb>`, according to [official documentation](https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Word_boundary), is wrong. It should be

`<?wb>` or the hard-to-understand `<|w>`.

Second, the comment "required between word characters, optional otherwise" is just plain wrong. It's confusing language. A word character should be \[a-zA-Z0-9_\] or any Unicode letter. If we take "Hello world!", "between word characters" therefore would mean any point where I added a \^:

`H^e^l^l^o w^o^r^l^d!`

Those points aren't places where whitespace is required. Quite the opposite.

What the author means to say is "between words" or more verbosely, "between a word character and a non-word character." If we ignore both ends, there are exactly two points where `<ws>` can occur:

`Hello^world^!`


![_attachments/Table 15-1. Named character classes.png|450](/img/user/_attachments/Table%2015-1.%20Named%20character%20classes.png)

In terms of confusing writing, seriously I'm appalled, but one instance is forgivable. Will watch out for more.

## Setting out to get to the bottom of whitespace

After the horrible findings above, I set out to gain absolute clarify.

# Perl 6 Notes

## Whitespace (ws)

- `token` and `rule` are different from `regex` by adding ratcheting (non-backtracking).
- `rule` also inserts `<.ws>` **ONLY** where there is a literal space, specifically:
	- After terms and other named things
	- ***But not*** at the beginning of the rule #todo/verify

### An over-the-top but super clarifying example

To absolutely understand ws handling, here's some actual code (fn1) to confirm what I suspect to be true.

```
my token tn {<alnum>}  
my token t {\d \d}  
my token t_anchored {^ \d \d $}  
my token t_trailing_backslash_s {\d \d\s}  
my rule r {\d  \d}                        # two spaces  
my rule r_nospace {\d\d}  
my rule r_nospace_from_named {<tn><tn>}  
my rule r_space_from_named {<tn> <tn>}  
my rule r_training_space {\d  \d }        # two spaces 
my rule r_training_backslash_s {\d  \d\s} # two spaces 
```
Output:

Each of these 16 cases has been confirmed.
```
「42」 matched token t {\d \d}
「 42」 matched token t {\d \d}
「 42」 does not match token t_anchored {^ \d \d $}
「4 2」 does not match token t {\d \d}
「42」 does not match token t_trailing_backslash_s {\d \d\s}
「42」 does not match rule r {\d  \d}
「42」 matched rule r_nospace {\d\d}
「4 2」 does not match rule r_nospace {\d\d}
「4 2」 does not match rule r_nospace_from_named {<tn><tn>}
「42」 does not match rule r_space_from_named {<tn> <tn>}
「4 2」 matched rule r {\d  \d}
「4  2」 matched rule r {\d  \d}
「4   2」 matched rule r {\d  \d}
「 4   2」 matched rule r {\d  \d}
「 4 2」 matched rule r_training_space {\d  \d }
「 4 2」 does not match rule r_training_backslash_s {\d  \d\s}
```

---
fn1: I had to use the `.gist` method and the `&` method reference in `&t.gist` to print `token t {\d \d}`. I hope I'll learn an easier way to stringify a regex object.

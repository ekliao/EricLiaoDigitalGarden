PKM stands for *personal knowledge management*.

A PKM system is used for [[Note-taking\|Note-taking]], as opposed to [[Consecutive Note-Taking\|Consecutive Note-Taking]], and for managing notes and documents in various formats.

## Note-taking/Annotation Apps
*Apps that clearly don't count as PKM are listed here.* 
(Update 2023-07-18) I have neglected categorization of the long list above for long. It's futile trying to pigeon hole each of them. It's an exercise best suited for dataview and Tana)

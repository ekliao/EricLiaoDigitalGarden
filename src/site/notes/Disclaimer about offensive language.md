In order to discuss language per se or test and illustrate the results of using AI tools (such as ChatGPT), you may find mentions or made-up uses of offensive language (pejorative, sexist, racist, etc.). These mentions or uses do not represent my thoughts nor are they meant to offend. They are for the purposes of linguistic discussion only.

#mynote Perhaps it was partly serendipity and partly tenacity, I got Disqus working while having zero knowledge about componentization (include files, etc.) of a website. Credit all goes to [utsob](https://hermitage.utsob.me/ ) (my [thanks](https://glasp.co/highlight-embed?u=zeYBfVAGSvNl7zMHjBkmeoK0t0g1&d=GIk4F86kOFIl9B2B642P&h=9kwp7xbr8dfzjqlp&m=h) and the [context of the help](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/10pokli/i_built_a_digital_garden_using_obsidian_for_free/)) for pointing the way twice.

Steps
1. Register an account with [Disqus]([https://disqus.](https://disqus.com/)
2. Install it according to the site's [platform](https://ericliaointerpreting-netlify-app.disqus.com/admin/settings/install/). My site is built with [[Web publishing with Obsidian + Github + Netlify\|Github + Netlify]], not in the pre-defined list, so I had to [manually install Disqus using the Universal Code](https://ericliaointerpreting-netlify-app.disqus.com/admin/settings/universalcode/)
3. #paste/glasp/link I saw someone's [success](https://glasp.co/highlight-embed?u=zeYBfVAGSvNl7zMHjBkmeoK0t0g1&d=GIk4F86kOFIl9B2B642P&h=97ia3eqcu5xz4xij&m=h)

### Highlights & Notes

- Disqus is pretty easy. Just copy the universal code from Disqus. See the `note.njk` and `comment.njk` files in my repo: https://github.com/uroybd/topobon/
- I'm using Netlify's free tier
- It doesn't prevent you from adding Disqus. Just copy and paste the universal Disqus embed code from the Disqus dashboard, put it in a file in the `_includes` and import it in the note's template.

This majorly piqued my interest.

## Hello, Disqus!

Hooray! I did it again! This time, I added [[Adding Disqus to Netlify\|Disqus]] commenting function to my website, following this failed attempt:

just a few days ago, all thanks to the kind owner of https://hermitage.utsob.me/ for pointing out what I did wrong.

The change is not perfect, for I discovered the wonky placement and disappearance of the light/dark theme switch on the page. Still, it's a rewarding feeling that putting in the work pays off.

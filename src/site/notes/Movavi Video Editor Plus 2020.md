Slower and not as good quality as [[Movavi Video Editor 4\|Movavi Video Editor 4]] in reducing file size.
# Best practice

No matter what the resolution of downsampling, it's okay to set quality to be "good" (lowest level) but make sure it's at least 50% (not 40% or even 45%) to avoid having flickering snowiness in resultant video. In the past, I've done 33%-45% but the warbling video is always observed. Ironically, the cheaper [[Movavi Video Editor 4\|Movavi Video Editor 4]] doesn't suffer from this.

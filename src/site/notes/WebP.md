- weppy, not weepy :-)

### Highlights & Notes
- WebP is a modern image format that provides superior lossless and lossy compression for images on the web. Using WebP, webmasters and web developers can create smaller, richer images that make the web faster.  
- WEBP (pronounced as “Weppy”) is an image format developed by Google. This format was designed to be used specifically on the web. 
- WebP uses features of both lossy and lossless compression algorithms which greatly reduces the file size while retaining the quality of the original image.  WebP lossless images are 26% smaller in size compared to PNGs. WebP lossy images are 25–34% smaller than comparable JPEG images

It's here. AI interpretation replaces humans at $112.50 per hour in city meetings, almost 4 times cheaper. AI mistakes are no longer a valid argument as long as their benefits are perceived to outweigh the risks. Besides, who can be sure that human interpreters don't make mistakes, perhaps even more so by omissions?

The adoption of AI translation is cheaper than hiring human translators. Garnett said the city pays $112.50 for every hour the service is used, and has so far paid about $4,308 for more than 38 hours of usage. Hiring an human translator would cost the city up to $400 per hour. “This creates a much smoother dialogue than using live interpreters,” she  told San José Spotlight. “We likely would have needed two to four live interpreters to accomplish what we are doing with Wordly.”

該來的還是來了。AI口譯將會從底層漸漸蠶食真人口譯的工作。

After painstakingly agreeing to allow communications between the aggregator app with each of these (see pictures) messaging apps, one after another by providing login information and giving explicit consent, this is the sweet fruit of labor: I can now use a single app to view messages from all connected apps and reply from within it. 

There's one glaring absence: Apple's own iMessage app. This integration isn't possible even on Apple's own ecosystem of MacOS and iOS. Ironic much? Here's the [scoop](https://hyp.is/9uD4iveFEe6-ouvhIl36Vg/zapier.com/blog/beeper-vs-texts/). (Read the [NYT](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/12/22/technology/apple-iphone-beeper-mini.html) article if you have access to it.)

Actually, there's another big miss for people in Taiwan: Unfortunately your åœ‹æ°‘è»Ÿé«” LINE is not considered popular enough to be included. This is another unfortunate downside for me too because some of my contacts use LINE exclusively. I won't name names; this is not a place for public shaming ðŸ˜‚

I immediately noticed another limitation: On apps where one can have multiple accounts, only one account can be connected this way at any given time.

Despite the issues, I like the idea very much. I am enjoying viewing all messages in the Inbox and replying to some of them, all in one place on the desktop or on my iPhone.

It'll obviously take a while to experience usage issues. Hope there won't be any showstoppers. Check back later.

## The usually dreadful middle-tier

Translation and interpretation agencies come in two varieties: those who are professional enough to do their coordinating job well and those who are leeches and bottom-feeders. Needless to say, the former bunch is a rare breed, and you can't throw a stone on the busiest intersection in San Francisco without hitting one of the latter.

For interpreters who aren't incorporated and behave like agencies, like me, agencies are a necessary evil. We can only strive toward working with the lesser of the two evils described here.

# Reading 《Parsing With Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars》

This is rather like drinking from the fire hose that is the beast of Perl 6. But I must say, what I used to dream of doing, parsing structured text files, is now only a Perl 6 grammar away. It's finally definitely reachable without having to jump through hoops made of the tool Yapp or the Parse::Yapp Perl 5 module and deal with all the ugliness. In Perl 6, when a match is made, everything is captured into the $/ variable, immediately manipulable into the intended new form.

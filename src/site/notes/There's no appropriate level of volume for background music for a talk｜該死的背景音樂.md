I have a visceral disgust for any talk that's literally ruined by background music, especially when the music is loud & distracting like [this](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxnygUAYfDUaKOY6m3kZLcKbmbaCzn77tp?si=I7gaVwgKl-cB-IHS). Please just stop this attack on your listeners' ears. You are turning the audience away. If they want to enjoy real music or understand a talk, they wouldn't be listening to you. In other words, the only appropriate volume level of background music is zero.

### Experiment with AI translation

I happen to have recently set up a language learning plugin, creatively named "Language Learner," which offers instant lookup or machine translation of any words or amount of text I select in my note, assuming English or Chinese. It's amazingly seamless as plugins go.

| AI  | E-C                                                                                              |

| YD  | 我对任何被背景音乐破坏的谈话都有一种发自内心的厌恶，尤其是像这样嘈杂和分散注意力的音乐。请停止对听众的攻击。你在转移观众的注意力。如果他们想欣赏真正的音乐或理解谈话，他们不会听你的。      |
| DL  | 我从内心里反感任何被背景音乐毁掉的谈话，尤其是当音乐像这样嘈杂和分散注意力的时候。 请停止这种对听众耳朵的攻击。 你正在把听众拒之门外。 如果他们想欣赏真正的音乐或听懂演讲，他们就不会听你的。 |

### Creating flashcards of bilingual phrases inspired by AI's translation

This is another fun and incredibly useful Obsidian plugin I discovered recently, again even more creatively named Spaced Repetition.

By light editing of note content (like the one you're reading now) into one-line items containing two semicolons separating the "question" and "answer," that line turns into a flashcard ready for me to review and learn directly within Obsidian. See pictures below. 

Anki is not required, thank goodness! Despite its utility and popularity, I experienced some recent horror with issues of Obsidian freezing and hanging when attempting to create Anki cards from it using another set of plugin and Anki add-on. [[people/Yvonne Jiu 鞠雨融\|Yvonne Jiu 鞠雨融]] is the Taiwanese YouTuber whose great videos helped me learn the setup.

# ChatGPT Code Interpreter

I thought ChatGPT input of PDF files, MP3 audio, etc. is still a long ways away. I was so wrong.

## Ankiweb surprisingly fast

- Having experienced the awful slowness of Obsidian (iCloud and local) in handling 400K data, I gave Ankiweb a try. It's already there, but I actually never used it, assuming it wasn't going to be fast compared to the desktop app. Gosh, I was so wrong. On 1.2 million entries, the search for a headword takes less than 5 seconds, sometimes only 1-2 seconds. What a surprise!

# An eye-opening introduction to Heptabase

Watch this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=66Bn4xrshog&t=1169s). The co-creators of the YouTube channel Paperless Movement are so excited about Heptabase that they call it "one tool to rule them all." Okay, they did mention using it in tandem with [[Lazy\|Lazy]], this mysterious tool, which they think will replace [[MEM.ai\|MEM.ai]].

In five minutes' frantic rapid-fire showcasing Heptabase, they have sold me on the versatility and multifaceted views of this tool. I know it is created by a young Taiwanese genius, [[Alan Chan 詹雨安\|Alan Chan 詹雨安]]. That makes me feel really good.

According to [[Paco Cantero\|Paco Cantero]], Heptabase:
- Distills every single note-taking app
- Simplifies it to the best
- Combines their best features
- Without overcomplicating things
# Tools that Heptabase "replaces"

- Miro
- Scrintal
- Mem
- Obsidian
- Roam (also Logseq)
- Tana (but more intuitive, per [[Thomas Rödl\|Thomas Rödl]])
- Notion
- MarginNote
- Milanote
- Evernote
# Concepts

- Whiteboard
- Readwise/Reader integration
- Inbox (missing feature, workaround: hashtag "pending")

### Metadata
- Title: Predicative expression - Wikipedia
- Tags: #grammar, #English
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicative_expression

### Page Comment
- Unambiguous distinction between "(clause) predicate 謂語" and "predicative (expression) 表語", both nouns.

### Highlights & Notes
- A predicative expression (or just predicative) is part of a clause predicate.
	- It is an expression that typically follows a copula or linking verb, e.g. be, seem, appear, or
	- that appears as a second complement of a certain type of verb, e.g. call, make, name, etc. 
- The most frequently acknowledged types of predicative expressions are predicative adjectives (also predicate adjectives) and predicative nominals (also predicate nominals). 
- The main trait of all predicative expressions is that they serve to express a property that is assigned to a "subject", whereby this subject is usually the clause subject
- The formulations "over the subject" and "over the object" indicate that the predicative expression is expressing a property that is assigned to the subject or to the object.

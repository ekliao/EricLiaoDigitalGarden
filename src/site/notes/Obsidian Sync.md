I am so impressed by the seamless design of Obsidian/iCloud. With this completely free option, why would anyone pay for the $10/month or $96/year [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) service?

(Update 2023-05-10) iCloud syncing is slow and constantly causing Obsidian to index. Initially syncing 230K files is practically watching paint dry.

[Here](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/s7u7p5/people_who_use_obsidian_sync_whats_it_like_and_is/), most users are happy with the “set it and forget it” nature, but many said it's too expensive.

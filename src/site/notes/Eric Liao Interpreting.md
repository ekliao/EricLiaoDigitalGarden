My [[Eric Liao - CV\|CV or résumé]]. 

Welcome! This is my first attempt at publishing my nascent digital garden to the world, FWIW. Feel free to roam, linger, leave, or connect by email (ekliao@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/ericliaointerpreter).

I am a freelance conference and court interpreter based in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. Here's my [[Eric Liao - CV\|CV or Résumé]]. I am originally from Taipei, Taiwan. I interpreter between English and Mandarin Chinese, and also from Taigi (aka Southern Min, Hokkien, or Fukienese).

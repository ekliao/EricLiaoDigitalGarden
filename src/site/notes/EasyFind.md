## Pros
- Free
- [[Regex\|Regex]] search of file names and content
## Cons
- A query can't operate on BOTH file names and content. Only one.

To my disappointment, [[EasyFind\|EasyFind]] does not reliably find text in files as expected. I tried to look for a simple fixed string `disqus` in a directory tree of files and it found fewer files than expected. I have no idea why such a simple search failed. In comparison, the tried-and-true [[Text Editors#^81cbb4\|Text Editors#^81cbb4]] (available on Windows only, alas) did fine.

## Verdict
- Use it mainly for quick search of files by name. Nothing else.

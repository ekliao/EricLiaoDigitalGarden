- Went out for the first time on the 7th day of my arriving in Taipei for vacation! This record-breaking staying-in when there's no more fear of catching COVID shows how well my mom and family feed me and how I am naturally a homebody.
- Today's outdoor experience reaffirmed how Taipei and Xinbei are ideal for living with convenience of transport and 24/7 convenience stores everywhere. The key is having a place within 5 minutes' walk to any subway station, which translates into high price, easily 50, even 70-80 *wan* per *ping* (Âù™). Being a homebody, that's a price I'm willing to pay for time-saving convenience.
- Only lately did I come to know of Andy Matuschak and I was in awe of his thoughts on note-taking. So I'm watching a video of him talking for the first time, demoing a 13" Dasung e-ink monitor for a powerful MacBook because the black-and-white lower refresh rate helps calm him down when he needs to organize his mind and write thousands of words while reading an academic paper. That's a refreshing idea.

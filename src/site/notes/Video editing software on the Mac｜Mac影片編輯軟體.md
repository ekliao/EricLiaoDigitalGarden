Summary of [Best video editing software for Mac - 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ahvtKcMevrc)
# Recommended
## [[CapCut\|CapCut]]

Free. Made by the same company that made TikTok: ByteDance. For basic light-weight editing but more powerful than [[iMovie\|iMovie]]. Beware of security/privacy concerns because of the association with China.
## [[DaVinci Resolve 18\|DaVinci Resolve 18]]

A pro-grade video editor like Final Cut Pro or Adobe Premiere. Has a completely ***free*** version and a one-time paid version ($285) with bells and whistles. Hollywood studios use this to make movies!
# Other software programs mentioned

- Filmora
# Conclusion

Never in a million years would I think a pro-grade video editing program is free. Sounds like [[DaVinci Resolve 18\|DaVinci Resolve 18]] is the way to start my video-editing journey on the M3. If it turns out to be too much, I'll try CapCut next.

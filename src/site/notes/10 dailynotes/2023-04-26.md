## Hello, Disqus!
{ #7354c7}


Hooray! I did it again! This time, I added [[Adding Disqus to Netlify\|Disqus]] commenting function to my website, following this failed attempt: 
<div class="transclusion internal-embed is-loaded"><a class="markdown-embed-link" href="/10-dailynotes/2023-04-24/#7e438f" aria-label="Open link"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" class="svg-icon lucide-link"><path d="M10 13a5 5 0 0 0 7.54.54l3-3a5 5 0 0 0-7.07-7.07l-1.72 1.71"></path><path d="M14 11a5 5 0 0 0-7.54-.54l-3 3a5 5 0 0 0 7.07 7.07l1.71-1.71"></path></svg></a><div class="markdown-embed">



* Turns out, adding [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)-style commenting support to my digital garden wasn't as easy as it seems, by simply putting some universal code snippet (with one change) in a file under the `_include` directory. I hit a snag. 
	#highlight/glasp/link  [My problem and getting further pointers](https://glasp.co/highlight-embed?u=zeYBfVAGSvNl7zMHjBkmeoK0t0g1&d=GIk4F86kOFIl9B2B642P&h=q7grki25c15lga58&m=h) 

</div></div>
just a few days ago, all thanks to the kind owner of this [digital garden](https://hermitage.utsob.me/) on Reddit for pointing out what I did wrong.

The change is not perfect, for I discovered the wonky placement and disappearance of the light/dark theme switch control on the page. Still, it's a rewarding feeling that putting in the work pays off.

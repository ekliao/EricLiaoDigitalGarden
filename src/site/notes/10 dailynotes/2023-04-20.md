- Figured out how to sync an Obsidian vault between MacOS desktop and iOS (iPhone for now). 
	- Created a new vault called EricLiao on iPhone
	- Linked it to iCloud (part of the feature; irreversible)
	- On desktop, saw the iCloud Obsidian folder EricLiao
	- Duplicated everything under `Ekliao` including settings (under `.obsidian`) from the original `Ekliao` vault to the new iCloud vault folder `EricLiao`
	- Verified on iPhone (after iCloud synced automatically) that everything looked good
- #project/work-in-progress  Publish this digital garden from the [[iCloud\|iCloud]] Obsidian vault!

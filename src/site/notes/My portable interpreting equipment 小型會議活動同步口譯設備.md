# MixTech Wat01-NG2 portable wireless audio transceiver set

In case the meeting organizer is not able to provide the necessary equipment, I own a set of portable equipment and can provide simultaneous interpretation to up to six listeners. For a larger audience, the interpreting agency typically hires a separate contractor to provide equipment to meet the need.

# Handfree interpreting

I use such a head-worn microphone whose 3.5mm audio jack plugs into any transmitter. This has obvious advantages over a hand-held or lavalier/lapel mic:
- handfree
- clear pickup of my speech voice

## In terms of long-term storage/retrieval (of videos), what would be the upload limit/file and total storage? Are we better off linking externally i.e. a Dropbox link to the video?

#answer/authority/quote
It should be enough for all reasonable usage, and we will keep increasing it - we are working towards the idea that not only should you be able to store all of your personal information, but big teams should be able to collaborate on complex knowledge bases, so storage limitations/speed etc should not be holding people back.

## If not direct video uploads, what external video links will work as embedded thumbnails?

A: I'd recommend using YouTube. Embedding worksÂ  like a charm, just post the link and it comes up straight away. Even "unlisted" YouTube videos work.

# Hello, Comma IDE!

As soon as I installed Perl 6 on Mac and had the first script running successfully [[10 dailynotes/2023-07-01\|from the command line]], I was eager to find a GUI IDE that supports Perl 6 development on Mac. That feels like a really tall order, judging from past experience and the word on the street that Perl is dead.

Luckily, a bit of Googling led me to COMMA, and I installed it right away. The mention of the Raku (Perl 6) Plugin on its download page seems too good to be true.

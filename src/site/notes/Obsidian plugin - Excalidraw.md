I installed this only because it is required for [Excalibrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk3K4mlgOMM&list=PL6mqgtMZ4NP3dJlJLxqVm1rd3y-lWklLu) (officially available as a plugin), but what its creator [Zsolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2BD73hbUWk) reveals may imprint Excalidraw on the top of my mind: PDF freehand highlighting. Wonderful! None of that "straight-line highlighting/underlining and typed-text commenting" kind of "rÃ¨glo" nonsense ðŸ˜‚ Ã  la [[Obsidian plugin - Annotator (PDF)\|Obsidian plugin - Annotator (PDF)]].

As shown, I can't wait to get my hands dirty in marking up a PDF page with highlighters any way I want!

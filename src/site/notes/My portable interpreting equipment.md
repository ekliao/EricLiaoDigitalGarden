# MixTech Wat01-NG2 portable wireless audio transceiver set

I own two sets of these, so serving up to two listeners. This is sufficient because usually there's only one [[LEP 英語能力有限\|LEP]] person in a typical court case. For a larger audience, the interpreting agency typically provides equipment to meet the need.

# Handfree interpreting

I use such a head-worn microphone whose 3.5mm audio jack plugs into any transmitter. This has obvious advantages over a hand-held or lavalier/lapel mic:
- handfree
- clear pickup of my speech voice

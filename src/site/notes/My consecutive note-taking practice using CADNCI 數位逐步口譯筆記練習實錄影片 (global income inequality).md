This is a [live recording 實錄影片](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uMhVY60aTEU) of my consecutive note-taking in [David Violet's consecutive note-taking practice](https://david-violet-interpreter-school.teachable.com/p/practice-note-taking-for-consecutive-interpreting) session, Oct 27, 2023. I highly recommend David's practice sessions.

The [original video](https://www.ted.com/talks/chrystia_freeland_the_rise_of_the_new_global_super_rich) is slowed down for the practice.

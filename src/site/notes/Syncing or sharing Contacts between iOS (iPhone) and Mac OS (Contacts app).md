Just as I was going to dis the Apple ecosystem for dropping the ball on even the most basic functionality: syncing of Contacts across devices, it worked in front of my own eyes for the first time.

*(Update 2023-09-16)* A few days later, when I created a new contact on the iPhone for real, the Mac side didn't show it after moments have elapsed. I had to rely on Airdrop, which worked. Phew!

# Test (when sync works)

## Create a new contact on iPhone

Then, a moment later, on MacOS contacts app:

Change the name of the contact on iPhone, then one minute later on Mac:

The "note" field syncs too but not instantly.
# If auto-sync fails: Manually share it using e.g. Airdrop

Create a new contact on phone and share it to Mac through Airdrop:

Airdrop will send a .vcf file

On Mac, use this to create a contact.
# History: always on

I had Contacts on iCloud always, but my observation is that it doesn't always work.

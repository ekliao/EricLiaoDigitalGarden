This seems a cool tool I've been searching for to highlight and annotate a PDF file in OB.

#project/learn-by-doing 
#project/completed 
- Requires a new OB file/note pointing to the PDF
- Add frontmatter	
	- `annotation-target:<pdf-file-name-including-extension-dot-pdf`

- Can switch between three views (click `Show Annotation` in markdown view to go back to the PDf view)
	- Default annotation view (reading, highlighting and annotating it, with an annotation pane on the right and a outline pane on the left)
	- Markdown view (with lots of metadata, code, and the actual textual annotation, which can be searched). ==Keep this view read-only. See Pitfalls below==.
	- Reading mode of this markdown (nice!)

### Pitfalls
- (2023-05-08) Though tempting, don't ever ==edit the textual annotation directly in the markdown view==. It will cause the annotation view to not show properly!

# Issues

- The PDF annotation view does not work on iOS! Wah? I'm heart-broken. What's the point?

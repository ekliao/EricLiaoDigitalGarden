# Best selling point for Perl 6

[src: People of Perl 6: Carl Mäsak](https://www.perl.com/pub/2010/08/people-of-perl-6-carl-masak.html/)

## Q: What feature of Perl 6 will (and should) other languages steal?

I think the new regex/grammar features will be so attractive that other languages won’t be able to keep their grubby hands off them. Of course, they also won’t get the pervasiveness of regexes and grammars just by tacking them onto an existing language. —Carl Mäsak 

### Case in point: Perl 6 regex and grammar voodoo

Character class arithmetic has finally arrived.

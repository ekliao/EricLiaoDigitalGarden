This [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-sQDNVmsq4&t=563s) by Srini is worth watching to compare Mem to Obsidian, which I am sold on, and to Notion, which I never got into. Below's my Glasp on it.

Another [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t5YAJUbGxLU&t=16s) by Rafeh is noteworthy as it tries to persuade users away from Obsidian. Having wat

### Highlights & Notes

==Cool! Below is a Glasp timed comment with link to the clip.==
- ([10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e-sQDNVmsq4&t=655s)) knowledge is organized inside of a network versus a hierarchy the way it is in notion makes your notes more discoverable it makes it easier to make connections between your ideas and it makes it much easier to retrieve information and ultimately the biggest benefit of all is that it allows you to focus more on the content of your notes and less on the structure

- I had the same thought about Obsidian. Both have the "bidirectional linking" and network structure. The main difference is the interface that might be more user friendly here. For now, Obsidian is my to go App: - No login or account needed - You own your files on your machine - Files are text based (markdown) - Immensely powerful through extensions and scripting - Minimalist philosophy then add only the features you need The only thing is, you need trial and errors before to know how to organize it in an optimal way so it suit your needs (But it's mostly true for all PKM App, and that's a learning curve I'm willing to take, because the payoff are great)  I'm on my way to customize Obsidian to make it my all in one productivity / creativity / information database App

- I came from evernote, it took me 6months to transition and finally decided cut my evernote and use noton 100% base from this video.  if you are an evernote user and hate it.  you can easily transfer to mem without problem. mem is like what evernote should have been for more than 10yrs.   it's just the developer and CEO of evernote are idiots.  Evernote and mem are for ordinary peeps. you register and start using it. no configuration what so ever.  Notion is not for ordinary people.  notion is for technical people.  people who have "basic programming skills." and guess what. basic education now have basic programming skills in the curriculum.  so choosing which is which is simply asking yourself.  do you want start right now?   or do you want to build a system that will work for you?  if you do go get notion. if not go get mem. don't touch evernote.. you will regret it lol

	- Agreed.  And you're right that I don't have programming skills.  And each tool serves different needs for different people.  4   Reply   @KunleOladehin 6 months ago Good points. I actually use both. Notion is my systems tool (project management, client docs, etc) and Mem is my idea generation tool. I've found that Notion isn't a good dumping ground of random ideas. Like you mention, you have to think about how each page fits into the picture. I needed somewhere that I can instantly capture and take quick action without any friction.   If an note gets refined in Mem and eventually becomes a common resource, I migrate it into Notion because I've figured out how it's used and what it should connect to. Not sure what future developments might make me completely buy into one solution.

I can never sustain using keep,evernote,trello let alone Notion... maybe one can also use Mem as a training wheel for using Notion later on    Reply   @sciteceng2hedz358 4 months ago (edited) Yeah kinda thought the same thing. You can do Notion good or you can do it bad. Notion has bidirectional linking. But there are some properties in mem that seem interesting.  1   Reply   @SpacyPuccy 1 month ago https://youtu.be/t5YAJUbGxLU?t=16 this dude literally built a python script on obsidian (note-taking software more technical than notion) and left for mem    Reply   @SouravGhoshji 3 days ago ⁠ @maximizeyouroutput  I am not a programmer but technical definitely.   After going through August Bradley’s PPV framework on YouTube & understanding how Notion works, my Notion can do everything you’ve mentioned Mem do better than Notion.   In fact, I found the Mem interface & workflow confusing.   But surely different person has different preferences.

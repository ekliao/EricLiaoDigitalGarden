# Joplin

</div>



# Hello, and good-bye, Joplin!

I created this first impression [video](https://youtu.be/ohWfF-VHF7Q) about Joplin.

## Quick verdict: 2 stars

## Update 2023-07-17

While I dissed Joplin for not having Logseq (LQ) and the like's searchable block ref by name, I just learned that in LQ it's normal action to do a `CTRL-C` in target block to get its block ref code and paste into the referring block. Maybe I was too harsh on Joplin, but I still think that the LQ keyboard shortcut beats requiring mouse right-click. Carpal-tunnel much?

# Trading sleep for a 5AM job paying peanuts
Today I successfully completed an online interpretation assignment. I accepted this rather low-paying job for a clear reason. While it went well, I am writing this down, stating that for the record I will not sacrifice sleep again for a job that starts at 5AM when it was still dark outside. The last time I did this was two years ago, twice, when I took two WHO assignments in the ungodly hours of 3AM. I was just starting out, and would take anything just to have the experience. The pay was at least reasonable. This time, it was a lowball pay. Normally I wouldn't even think about it, especially if the event is heavily scripted, requiring extra hours to prepare. Yes, I accepted this job with the specific goal in mind. In hindsight, I won't trade my sleep and health for this again, unless the pay is at least 3X as much. When will that happen with this agency? When hell freezes over.

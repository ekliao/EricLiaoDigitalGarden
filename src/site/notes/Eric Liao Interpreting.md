Here's my curriculum vitae/CV/résumé in [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2w2NirxGCWH6FfUQIGFDNAa1wWMs3oS/view?usp=sharing) or [Word doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSfvw_oGpZYrjDhLmePZDfkx-2DQbcLdtMUTyIZMV40/edit?usp=sharing) *(Last update: Jan 16, 2023)*
 
Welcome! This is my nascent and organically growing digital garden, open to the world, FWIW. Feel free to roam, linger, leave, or connect by email (ekliao@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/ericliaointerpreter).

I am a freelance conference and court interpreter based in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. I am originally from Taipei, Taiwan. I interpreter between English and Mandarin Chinese, and also from Tâigí (aka Southern Min, Hokkien, or Fukienese).

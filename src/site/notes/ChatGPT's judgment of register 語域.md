Q: Translate the following Chinese into English, paying special attention to tone, degree of slang, formality, and register: 爸爸打了小孩的屁股。這一針，不能打在肩膀，護士說，必須打在屁股上。

A: Dad spanked the child's buttocks. For this injection, it can't be administered on the shoulder. The nurse said it must be given on the buttocks.

The Chinese sentences are written in a straightforward and formal style, without any slang or informal language. The tone is neutral and informative, conveying factual information without any emotional emphasis. The level of formality is appropriate for a written text or a formal conversation.

Q: In the response, is "ass" a better choice than "buttocks" for the same degree of formality in the source language?

No, "ass" would not be a better choice than "buttocks" for the same degree of formality in the source language. In fact, "buttocks" is the more appropriate and formal term to use in this context. "Ass" is a more colloquial and informal term for buttocks, and its usage could be considered too casual or even offensive in certain settings.

In general, it's important to match the level of formality and register of the source language when translating, and to avoid introducing any inappropriate slang or informal language that could detract from the original tone and meaning.

Q: In the response, is "butt" a better choice than "buttocks" for the same degree of formality in the source language?

Using "butt" instead of "buttocks" would lower the degree of formality in the response. "Butt" is still a relatively informal term, and it might sound too casual in a formal setting.

While "butt" is more commonly used in informal conversation, "buttocks" is the more appropriate term for a formal or written context. It's always important to consider the level of formality in the source language when translating, and to choose the appropriate equivalent that matches the tone and register of the original text.

Q: Translate the following Chinese into English, paying special attention to tone, degree of slang, formality, and register: 

我的天啊，那個檳榔西施穿著一件短牛仔褲，屁股好圓、好翹、真漂亮，好想過去抓一把！

Oh my god, that betel nut beauty is wearing short denim shorts. Her buttocks are so round, so perky, so beautiful. I really want to go over and grab a handful!

The original Chinese text contains some colloquial and informal language, as well as some sexual overtones, which should be reflected in the English translation. The tone is informal and conversational, with a hint of excitement and admiration. The level of formality and register is relatively low, suitable for casual conversation or social media posts.

Q: I disagree with the use of "buttocks." It's too formal here. "Butt" or even "ass" would be better. What do you think?

A: As an AI language model, my primary goal is to provide accurate and appropriate translations based on the context and tone of the source text.

While "buttocks" is a more formal term and may sound out of place in a casual conversation, it is still the most accurate translation of the original Chinese term "屁股" in this context.

On the other hand, "butt" is a more casual term that could be used instead of "buttocks" without significantly changing the meaning or tone of the sentence. However, using "ass" would lower the level of formality and might introduce some vulgarity or offensiveness that was not present in the original text.

Ultimately, the choice of word depends on the desired tone, register, and level of formality in the translation.

While ChatGPT excels over many working T&Iers in writing impeccable English (grammatically speaking), I still contend with its use of `buttocks` for the last example. It's too clinical and formal. In this instance, my choice would be `ass`. 

So, I upped my game and came up with a spicier text and made special instructions for the translation like this:
```
Q: Translate the following Chinese into English, paying special attention to register, using the tone and register for fictional writing to express the language of an ogling lecherous fowl-mouthed low-class truck driver stopping at the betel nut stand: 

歐買尬，那個檳榔西施穿了一件短牛仔褲，屁股有夠翹有夠美的，拎北好想過去抓一把！幹！

A: Oh my god, that betel nut beauty's wearing a pair of short denim shorts. Her ass is so perky and so damn beautiful. I really wanna go over there and grab a handful! Shit!

This translation captures the register and tone of a lecherous, fowl-mouthed, low-class truck driver who has stopped at a betel nut stand. The translation uses colloquial language, slang, and profanity to convey a low level of formality and a crude, vulgar tone, which is appropriate for the context of the original text.
```

To my satisfaction, the expected crude/vulgar term  `ass` for `屁股` appeared in the response.

I think here ChatGPT and other LLMs face a challenge of unequal degree of vulgarity between the English term `ass` and the Chinese term `屁股`, with the latter enjoying a much wider range in register, going from neutral leaning informal to vulgar, than `ass`, which is unmistakably vulgar.

# .SRT to re-sequence

Upload to Google Gemini an .srt subtitle file where you need the sequence numbers re-ordered (by adding an offset, starting from a new number).
# Prompt

process the file this way: identify the natural whole numbers that occupy a single line, such as 1, 2, 3, etc. and re-count it from 668 and on. So, 1 becomes 668, 2 becomes 669, and so on. Change nothing else. Print everything else as is, preserving new lines. print as txt or generate a .srt file for download.
# Results

While interpreting in court today, I learned a new term from a judge's written ruling, "collateral estoppel." I came home to consult ChatGPT (3.5), which led me to another legal term "affirmative defense": 
### An affirmative defense is a defense asserted by the defendant that essentially says, “even if all of the facts in the complaint are correct, I’m still not liable for a different reason.”

Seeing that there is a negative clause ("not liable") followed by a prepositional phrase, for which the scope of "not" either applies or does not. Knowing which case it is is a frequent issue in grammar and semantics that can trip up human translators and interpreters unless they understand the context, which makes the meaning clear despite the inherent ambiguity. So, I decided to feed the same text into all machine translation engines and AIs I know to see how they perform.

# How many MTs and AIs does it take to get this right?

The verdict: only two out of a dozen got it right. I am not surprised they are mostly wrong, incorrectly bringing the prepositional phrase "for a different reason" under or into the scope of "not." 

I'm delighted that Claude AI (from Anthropic) got it 100% right. This is the very first test I gave it. I signed up only today, having learned that it may be a good choice for linguists.

Google Bard got it right too. That's nice. I have a bit more respect for it now as opposed to ChatGPT. But for a strange reason it somehow got the term "affirmative defense" wrong. I gave it 80%.

With such low overall performance in English-to-Chinese translation for a simple and not uncommon legal text, I am for now relieved for us human interpreters.

今天出庭做口譯，從法官的書面裁定中學到一個新詞，“collateral estoppel”。回家後我問了ChatGPT (3.5)，從而發現另一個法律術語“affirmative defense”：

An affirmative defense is a defense asserted by the defendant that essentially says, “even if all of the facts in the complaint are correct, I’m still not liable for a different reason.”

由於這裡有一個否定的子句（“not liable”）後面跟著一個介系詞片語，“not” 的否定範圍是否涵蓋該介系詞片語，這是文法和語義中經常出現的一個問題，人類口筆譯者若不小心會弄錯，但一旦理解了上下文，儘管存在文法上固有的模糊性，意思也明確清楚。所以我決定測試一下已知的機譯引擎和人工智慧，看各家表現如何。

十幾個機譯或人工智慧翻譯大多數搞錯意思，這我並不感到驚訝，大多都誤把 for a different reason 納入“not”的否定範圍。

很樂見 Claude 百分之百正確，擠霸昏！這是我給它的第一個測試，我今天才註冊帳號，之前聽說它可能是譯者的不錯的工具。

Google Bard 也翻對了重點部分，很棒，我對它更敬重了（相較於ChatGPT），但它很不爭氣，搞錯了“affirmative defense”這個詞，所以給它80分。

看到這樣一個簡單且並不罕見的法律文本，機譯和AI整體的表現如此掉漆，2266，我們人類口譯員還可以放鬆一下下。

#wip
Below is an example of a copy-and-paste onto OB a note with some text and two pictures, directly from Apple Notes app on Mac. The two pictures were initially *not copiable* this way and left two wide blanks. They had to be manually singly selected, copied, and then pasted. What pain this is!

## Exporter app for Export

Turns out this is also one of the note that the [[Exporter\|Exporter]] app reports being unable to export to .md in its en masse export.

The overall fail rate is 1% (12 out of 1063) in my first experiment.

This export of 1000 notes took about 30 minutes. A bit slow.

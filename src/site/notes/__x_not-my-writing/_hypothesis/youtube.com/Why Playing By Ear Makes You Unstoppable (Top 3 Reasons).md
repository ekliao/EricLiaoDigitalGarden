why was I able to do that okay because I You can hear the melody was going 355 1 7 55 5 6 54 right. It's harder to say it than it is to play it. Um that goes 3 55 51 7 uh 5 32. Right? So I'm able to hear the scale degrees. I'm able to hear the chords 6 1 54.

### Annotation
As soon as I heard him sing in movable do or in scale degrees instead of fixed do or absolute note names (A-G), I subscribed. It's a rare kind of teacher who does that, unfortunately.

一聽到這位老師用1-7數字（或相對的「可移動Do」唱名系統）來表達旋律： 3551 755654 3551 7532
而不是絕對音名（A-G），例如（假設是G調）：
B D D G 升F D D E D C ...
我就追蹤他頻道了，因為懂得會用 scale degree 音階級數來表達的老師，十個大概不到一個，大多西方（英美）的音樂老師好像從小都是學了絕對音名A-G那一套，對學習功能和聲和和弦與主音之間關係，一點幫助都沒有！

# A successful succession

Despite a couple of attempts, never in the last 13 years have there been any keyboards I tried that ended up replacing the good old Lenovo SK-8815 (L) (bottom). Now, after a few weeks of use, I was surprised to find that my hands and fingers actually developed a better kind keyboard "proprioception" with the new [[Nuphy Air75 (mechanical wireless multi-device keyboard)\|Nuphy Air75 mechanical wireless keyboard]] (top) that my fingers are surprisingly more in tune with the new when I touch typed or looked for those function keys or combination keys. I have successfully broken in this new keyboard, and I'm glad to have it in my daily work. It's versatile (can be connected to up to four devices) and portable.

#### Highlights & Notes

- Evergreen notes should be atomic It’s best to create notes which are only about one thing—but which, as much as possible, capture the entirety of that thing.  This way, it’s easier to form connections across topics and contexts.

/ and less top-down organizational and taxonomic or with too much enumerating. The latter tendencies are perhaps out of an innate predilection for order and neatness, or even OCD, but I can feel they will end up obstructing thinking rather than foster it. Let thought run free and be expressed freely in notes scattered about, and links and backlinks will take care of connecting them.

For example, forget about neatly creating hierarchical notes like this

| [[Dictionaries\|dictionaries]] 
| ---- [[AHD5\|AHD5]]
| -------- issue of grammar found in an AHD5 definition

just so that I can write about a seemingly quirky intransitive sense for `discuss` in AHD5. Rather, just write about the substantive issue of [[Absolute verbs\|Absolute verbs]], link it to the most obvious topic of [[Grammar\|Grammar]] to create at least one connection, and stop caring about whether `dictionaries` or `AHD5` should exist or how and where they should fit in.

## As shown

- All attachments (pictures, videos, etc.) go into the same folder 'Files' without further distinction, even if they are from different notebooks.
- Under 'notebooks', there is a separate folder for each notebook's text content.
- On the top level, all of text content files repeated again, this time merged if they are from multiple notebooks (not shown here).

### Conclusion

No separation of attachments. This is a minor annoyance but understandable. Contribute to bloat if you have many attachments from different notebooks. Best to export one large notebook at a time.

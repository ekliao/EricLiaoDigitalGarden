# AI v human interpreters 真人口譯和AI大車拼

[video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnr5nWhCF2o)

Being the pessimist, I think Barry was being too hard on AI regarding the "new currency issues" issue. It's not a wrong word choice. Besides, the context of the following words (usually the dollars, euros, yen) makes it rather clear to me. The real issue is how he admits being taken aback by how AI was able to interpret at almost 200 wpm without losing any details.

I don't care how hard these two experienced interpreters emphasize it's not a "replacement." For me, the real comparison and judgment comes only if they make the AI and human output available, in audio, for me to listen to and evaluate. Anything less smacks of ignoring the elephant in the room.

### Highlights & Notes
- ([06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xnr5nWhCF2o&t=409s)) I was taken aback by the artificial intelligence's ability to get all of the content and hold on to it so in terms of completeness it was very good and better than what I was able to do at that rate of speed however it often had mistakes and and challenges 07:36 with making the syntax the word choice and sometimes the grammar in English and sometimes it would choose words that weren't really the most accurate way the way a native English speaker would say something it talked about new currency issues listen inflation generated by the incorporation of new currency issues usually dollars Euros Yen which was really ambiguous because it was talking about new infusions of cash or currency into the monetary system and people could confuse issues with problems and think okay 08:11 what's the problem

Started using it only for the ability to painlessly import Evernote ENEX, keeping Evernote tags (in two ways). Also, for good measure, its multiple export format choices: markdown, html, PDF, etc.

(2023-12-03) Started paying a super affordable $0.99/month to use it. After a while, I may consider buying its onetime lifetime license for just $30 (price for the U.S.; it's each cheaper in Taiwan). 
# Quick verdict: 4/5

## Pros
### Preserving Evernote metadata and tags like no other tools can

- Affordable: $1/month or $30 onetime purchase
- Though a cloud solution, exporting all notes for local backup is fast, robust, and can be set up at regular intervals.
- Turns Evernote tags into two styles: hashtags (most universal) or its own notebook name
- Upnote not only preserves metadata like creation time and modification time (and tags), it even makes sure the markdown files generated today (2023) have the creation time and modification time that mimic the original times!! Thank you so much!!

## Cons

### Lacking a good web clipper solution like Evernote

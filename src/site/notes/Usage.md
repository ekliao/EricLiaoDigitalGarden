Language usage, including punctuation and spelling.

- 即便 vs. 即使
I like how this article cites attested historical examples to support 即便 as conjunction meaning "even though/if":

- etc
*et cetera* already means there are items left unsaid, so it coincides with the ellipsis. 
Don't say: `A, B, C...etc.`
Say: `A, B, C, etc.`

- cancelation | cancellation
While rules favor the spelling with a single L if it appears in an unstressed syllable (e.g. cancel), "cancellation" with double Ls is an exception and the dominant spelling in the United States. I spell it this way too.

Hello, my name is Eric Kehuang Liao and I go by Eric. I am a freelance ***conference interpreter*** and ***court interpreter*** based in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. I am originally from Taipei, Taiwan. 

Here's my CV/résumé in [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2w2NirxGCWH6FfUQIGFDNAa1wWMs3oS/view?usp=sharing) or [Word doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSfvw_oGpZYrjDhLmePZDfkx-2DQbcLdtMUTyIZMV40/edit?usp=sharing) *(last updated: Jan 16, 2023)*. I interpret between ***Mandarin Chinese*** *(native)* and ***English*** *(near-native)*, and also from *[Tâigí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien)*.
 
Welcome to my nascent and organically growing digital garden, a collection of notes in various stages of maturity and polish, open to the world, FWIW. 

To put this website in context, [Andy Matuschak's insight](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z4SDCZQeRo4xFEQ8H4qrSqd68ucpgE6LU155C) about thinking and writing notes for the self, disregarding the audience resonates with how I feel all along when blogging became a thing. What he says about [anti-marketing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu&stackedNotes=z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS), word!

Feel free to roam, linger, leave, or interact by email (ekliao@gmail.com) or [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/ericliaointerpreter) if you have any questions or just want to connect.

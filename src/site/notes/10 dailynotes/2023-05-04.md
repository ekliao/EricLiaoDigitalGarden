- I found myself embarking on a spur-of-the-moment daring project of experimental migration of at least partial Anki decks to Obsidian, just to test the intuition that the double-linking of OB outweighs Anki's SR offering for me.

Update: I spent most of 2024-05-04 doing lots of [[Regex\|regex]] wrangling and massaging, but the results, the first batch of 25,000 Anki vocabulary entries in Obsidian and enjoying OB's amazing unlinked mentions, immediately proved my intuition right. All the migration work was worth it. The Anki vocab list now looks like a living organism greeting me to play with it more, and discover and create more links within it. One really has to have used both systems on the same content to feel the power of connection!

- A plugin that doesn't quite deliver

Any functionality offering full-text indexing and search get my attention. This one for the OB vault definitely sounds awesome at first sight.

### Quick verdict: 2/5 stars
The underscoring search terms in in the results is nice. Looks like multiple search terms separated by spaces mean the `AND` operator: all of these terms, a typical “idiom.”

- *(2023-05-04)* On the first use I found a bug immediately:

![Screen Shot 2023-05-04 at 11.43.14.png](/img/user/_attachments/Screen%20Shot%202023-05-04%20at%2011.43.14.png)

As show, it treats `interpret` and `internet` as words with the same lemma through an obviously crude and dumb process of lemmatization.

To its defense, many tools out there, such as [[Cymo Note\|Cymo Note]], a CAI tool that I was interested enough to check out, don't even do any lemmatization but use the basest form of search: strict whole-string matching. Compared with them, some lemmatization is still a welcome effort.

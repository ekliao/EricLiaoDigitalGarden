# Observation

## How it handles attachments (pictures, etc.)

After export, a `_resources` folder is created with lots of individual folders named after the notes' titles, which in turn contain the ultimate pictures. It's really complicated. In the .md file referring to a picture, there's a link reference using relative path `./_resources/`. It just works. Make sure to place .md files and the `_resources` subfolder always in the same relative positions with each other.

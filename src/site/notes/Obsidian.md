==My "Hello World! moment in OB==
## First Note in Obsidian

Hello, [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/)! This is my first Obsidian note (2023-02-24)
How do I to do backlinks? Just type two opening square brackets.
This is like the personal wiki, [[EricWiki\|EricWiki]], back in the eBay days for me. So I am intuitively liking it already.
Will this become my second most powerful [[PKM\|PKM]] system, after [[Anki\|Anki]]?
Or, as they call it, my second brains?
In any case, [[Notion\|Notion]] feels like a complete overkill.

First image (testing attachment folder):

Nice! It's copy 'n' paste.

中文字體看來如何？

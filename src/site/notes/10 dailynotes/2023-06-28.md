# Todo list

I finally figured out how to enable todo checkbox functionality in Obsidian, using the community plugin `Checklist` coupled with the #todo tag, which can be hierarchical, e.g. #todo/work , #todo/waiting, #todo/someday-maybe, #todo/rsch (for research), etc.

Use `cmd-Enter` to cycle a bullet point and a checkbox. Same thing with `- []` (hyphen, space, square brackets).

#todo/OB 
- [x] Add todo checkbox to Obsidian

Yay!

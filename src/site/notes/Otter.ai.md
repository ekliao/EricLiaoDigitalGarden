For the first time, I almost used up Otter.ai's monthly allowance of transcription time. There's less than 5 hours left with 3 days to go. I feel I'm finally getting the bang for my buck.

I am one of the early paid subscribers who still enjoy 100 hours of monthly usage. Since Otter added an AI component, it has undercut monthly usage by more than 50%
for newer subscribers. I am not forever grandfathered; my usage will reduce per the new policy in 1.5 years in April 2025.

# Pros

- One of the best English AI transcribers there are in terms of accuracy and speed.
- Auto speaker identification
- Annotation/comments
- Highlighting
- The transcription can be edited.
# Cons

- Search using the date range does not work.
- Comments are not searchable like the transcription itself.
- Supports English only. Seriously?

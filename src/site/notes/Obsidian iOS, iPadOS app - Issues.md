# Issues
## In "sync config loop"
- *(2023-08-09)* This is so bad I have no words, except: this UX is a joke! I didn't even notice how it occurred, but it decided to go to the "sync config" mode even after coming out of it. At the touch of the iOS screen (such as going to settings menu or left nav bar), it will jump back into the loop. ðŸ˜­
- Gladly, I don't consider Obsidian iOS app to be essential right now.
## Always opening the last opened vault
- Unlike the desktop app that allows one to start Obsidian and open any vault from the menu, the iOS app insists on opening the vault it thinks it worked with last, potentially hanging if the vault has been stuck in iCloud hell, never giving the opportunity to switch to a working vault.
- Solution: When push comes to shove, see this solution:

## Hanging during initialization/iCloud syncing configuration
- Solution: Simply delete the app. Data and vaults on iCloud won't be affected. Reinstall the app and it'll recognize all vaults in iCloud. You'll get a reset in everything but vault settings and plugins are intact.

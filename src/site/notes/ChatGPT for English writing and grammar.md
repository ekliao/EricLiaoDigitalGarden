## Grammar

I found myself asking ChatGPT to check the grammaticality of an English passage or certain sentences, and am fascinated by what it thinks. For the most part, the way it's trained made it the perfect tool to pass judgment. For example:

#gpt 
```
Q: Analyze the grammatical correctness of the following sentences:

a. "Anything happen to you last week?"
b. "Anything happened to you last week?"
c. "Did anything happen to you last week?"
d. "Did anything happened to you last week?"

A:

a. "Anything happen to you last week?" - The sentence is grammatically correct, but it is more commonly used in informal speech. It uses the simple past tense to ask about an event that occurred in the past.

b. "Anything happened to you last week?" - The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The question is formed with the simple past tense and lacks an auxiliary verb, such as "did". The correct version of the question would be "Did anything happen to you last week?"

c. "Did anything happen to you last week?" - The sentence is grammatically correct. It uses the auxiliary verb "did" to form a grammatically correct question in the past tense.

d. "Did anything happened to you last week?" - The sentence is grammatically incorrect. The use of the simple past tense "happened" is redundant when the auxiliary verb "did" is used, so the correct form of the question is "Did anything happen to you last week?"

In summary, sentences (a) and (c) are grammatically correct, while sentences (b) and (d) are grammatically incorrect.

# Excited to encounter another PKM beast: Tana

Since I have no prior experience with Roam and Notion, Tana takes getting used to. But Ev at the end did a great job introducing it.

# Tana

</div>



# At a glance

- Unified design: everything is a node
- AirTable + Notion + Roam
- An outlining app rather than writing app like Obsidian
- Supertags
- Cloud
- $10/month or $100 a year
- Still in beta, not a full publicly available commercial product
- Norwegian

#PKM 
# Web publishing

Tana's web publishing works only through "workspace." Too much remains to be seen. I won't give up the current free and working Obsidian publishing solution for something this unknown.

### Which Is The Best? Tana or Obsidian?

#### Metadata
- Title: Which Is The Best? Tana or Obsidian?
- Tags: #Tana, #Obsidian, #web-publishing

#### Highlights & Notes
- Publish to web I’ve shared my digital garden online using Obsidian almost since the beginning. At first, I used Obsidian Publish and then started to experiment with different options, finally settling on the Digital Garden plugin.  I deleted my WordPress website and replaced it with my digital garden. It’s easy to update, even on my iPhone, a cinch to add new content and lends itself to writing.  Tana has an option to publish a workspace. I think this is to facilitate sharing templates at the moment rather than a full blown publication solution.

- Notes
	- Notion, AirTable
	- Backlinks
	- Outliner
	- Nodes (hierarchical)
	- Semantic structure through Supertags
		- Define something however you like
	- Tana templates (a bunch of fields)
		- Like creating applets or databases for anything
		- Sharable
	- Long ways to go to improve UI
	- AI
		- AI field
			e.g. AI-suggested action items based on YOUR content
			e.g. AI giving you critique of a plan
		- System of commands ("Tana Commands")
	- Command nodes
		- Ask AI
		- API
			- Webhooks
				- Whatsapp
				- Telegram
			- Automation / handshakes with other apps
	- Ecosystem (long-term goal)
		- Integration
		- Plugins
		- API
	- Input API
		- e.g. let GPT do some magic/coding for you, given sample data, like airline itineraries
		- AI for app builders
			- LangChain
	- Onboarding is a challenge for new users not familiar with workflows
	- Likely freemium model
	- AI is expensive

### Tana Paste

Markdown-like input text into Tana structures.

- Video notes
	- Block-based Outliner like Roam + database/structured data like Notion
	- Demo node: "idea for a long-form article"
		- Supertag
		- "Opening" a node = expand the bullet point
			- Reveals some fields like "status," "type." Are they built-in or user-defined?
		- Add a tag ("#spark idea")
			- Configure the tag (e.g. "#spark idea")
			- Here, "status" and "type" are shown as the first two fields, suggesting they are user-defined.
			- Define "default content"
				- e.g. "Brain dump" : a child node!
			- Define each field
				- type
		- Add another tag (e.g. "#YouTube video")
			- It gets its own default content: "YouTube script" node
				- Can have children nodes, further defining the "YouTube script" parent node
			- The fields of this tag can have the same name, e.g. "type"
				- Can identify/pick the same "type" field as used in "#spark idea"
	- Live searches
		- Construct a query (with auto-complete help), which can be named
			- Generates a list of nodes
			- Different views (e.g. table)
			- Can be filtered (through field values)
			- Her "Content Hub," mentioned by Note Aloud (Nicola Fisher) as inspiring, is an example of a named live search.
	- Foreshadows future introduction of Tana "workflows"

In 8 minutes' short video, E did a wonderful job getting me sold on Tana's main feature: Notion-like semantic structure.

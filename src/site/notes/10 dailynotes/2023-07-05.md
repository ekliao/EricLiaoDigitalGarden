# Learning Obsidian's Excalibrain plugin

At first blush, it is better than the generic graph view in that it has automatic notions of parents, children, and siblings. I am glad it automatically determined that my home page is the parent of "Latest Blogposts" and many published daily notes are naturally its children, as the unfiltered default Excalibrain graph shows. Neat!

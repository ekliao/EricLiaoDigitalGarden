## Seven-year itch with Anki?

Having set up Obsidian on February 24, 2023, I am experiencing accelerated fascination with it. In less than two months, I figured out how to publish a subset of my OB vault to the web for free, and soon after that, I am now hosting the published OB digital garden on my chosen professional domain name as a professional website!

One thing happened fast after another. Now I'm thinking of migrating Anki into OB. The reason is obvious: Anki and all [[Spaced repetition\|Spaced repetition]] systems like its grandfather [Supermemo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SuperMemo) don't have the dual linking OB is loved for, and I found myself wishing that for Anki, for I've built up Anki with million-strong entries and consider it an incredibly valuable asset.

So, I found Mochi. It looks promising.

## r/ObsidianMD - Is it possible to fully migrate from Anki to Obsidian?

### Metadata
- Title: r/ObsidianMD - Is it possible to fully migrate from Anki to Obsidian?

- URL: https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/kcg38l/is_it_possible_to_fully_migrate_from_anki_to/

### Highlights & Notes
- if you import your Anki decks into Mochi (https://mochi.cards/) and then you export them from Mochi as Markdown, Mochi export each card as just one Markdown file :).  This way is super easy and convenient to migrate your anki cards to obsidian
- When you export the cards as Markdown files you don't export the media files.  So if you work with audio and images it may break the deal.

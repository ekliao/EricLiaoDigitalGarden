- [nested tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags#Nested+tags) (/)
- [embedding a note](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files), or a [heading](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+heading+in+a+note) or a [block](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+block+in+a+note) of a note (! followed by usual double square-brackets), or embedding internal files (different formats) in general
	- Advantage: avoiding content duplication. *Write once, reference anywhere.*
		- Application: write something in a daily note and refer to it through embedding, because daily notes have the feel of chronologically documenting living, discovery, learning, and progress.
- [alias](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases) (front-matter) for effecting bilingual or multilingual notes, or translation of a source-language note

	- Or to a note: `[text](obsidian://vault/<name-of-vault>/<name-of-note-w-space-written-as-%20>)`
- block reference (>)
- swapping line up and down (cmd+1, cmd+2)

Zotero is a tool I've heard enough about but never tried until today. One showstopper feature I care about is handwritten annotation, which is woefully missing in the almost perfect [[Obsidian plugin - Annotator｜PDF註記插件\|Obsidian plugin - Annotator｜PDF註記插件]].
# Desideratum

Zotero's official forum thread below suggests that Zotero doesn't support freehand drawing on a PDF page. What a pity! By the way, they call this functionality "inking."

#### Highlights & Notes
- PDF Annotation: Inking bwiernik March 10, 2021 
	- I read a lot statistics PDFs. As I do, I like to write with a stylus on the page. For example, I will write alternative forms of an equation in the margins or write out steps of proofs that aren’t clear. I also like to circle parts of equations that are most relevant (the highlight tool often does a poor job of this). I would really like if Zotero’s new PDF reader could support the ink annotation tool for these purposes, especially as part the iPad app.

# Saving grace

That said, it took just a little Googling to dig deeper. I needed to confirm this "defect" before I am wiling to walk away from a promising new find. Glad I did! I am happy to report that the latest Zotero app on iOS actually supports inking, as evidenced in this [video](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1P54y1N7Gr/?spm_id_from=333.337.search-card.all.click). It's also confirmed by an official account:

# Trying is believing

With my interest piqued, I quickly installed the app on my iPad, learned how to add a PDF document to the desktop app (can't seem to do this on the iOS app), and learned how to turn on sync. Once sync was enabled, the first PDF document, my favorite grammar book, immediately appeared on the iPad app and I clicked it to download and open. I then scribbled the first hand-written note on a page:

![_attachments/IMG_9AA69E097BD2-1.jpeg|250](/img/user/_attachments/IMG_9AA69E097BD2-1.jpeg)

As if by magic, a few second later, the same handwriting appeared on the the desktop (Mac) app, with an extra dashed-line box:

This is so delightful to see! And seeing is believing. I am a believer!

I quickly learned how to annotate using the highlighter pen that comes in several default colors. It is fast and intuitive, more so than in [[LiquidText\|LiquidText]].
# Obsidian + Zotero = heavenly bliss

With this new found hope in finding the best way to annotate PDF including freehand drawing, I wasted no time in moving on to the next short-term goal, determined to look into ways to integrate Zotero into Obsidian. Indeed, there are several methods available, but I must take the time to understand what they actually do. First in line: [[Obsidian plugin - Zotero Integration｜Obsidian、Zotero 之聯動\|Obsidian plugin - Zotero Integration｜Obsidian、Zotero 之聯動]].

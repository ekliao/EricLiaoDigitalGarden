# At a glance
- Unified design: everything is a node
- Rem + Notion + Obsidian
- More accurately: Rem + Airtables
- An outlining app rather than writing app like Obsidian
- Supertags
- Cloud
- $10/month or $100 a year
- Still in beta, not a full publicly available commercial product

# Web publishing

Tana's web publishing works only through "workspace". Too much remains to be seen. I won't give up the current free and working Obsidian publishing solution for something this unknown.

#### Highlights & Notes
- Publish to web I’ve shared my digital garden online using Obsidian almost since the beginning. At first, I used Obsidian Publish and then started to experiment with different options, finally settling on the Digital Garden plugin.  I deleted my WordPress website and replaced it with my digital garden. It’s easy to update, even on my iPhone, a cinch to add new content and lends itself to writing.  Tana has an option to publish a workspace. I think this is to facilitate sharing templates at the moment rather than a full blown publication solution.

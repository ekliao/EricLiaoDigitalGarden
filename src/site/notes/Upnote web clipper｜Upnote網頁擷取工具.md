# Chrome

Upnote has a Chrome web clipper like Evernote. [This](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cwgjdYHm2ZE) is how it works. It's less versatile than Evernote but good enough: no bookmarks, no capturing a screen region, no simple version. Notably, no Gmail support. The Upnote clipper supports: whole page, selected portion. Images get captured too, along with a link to the original web page. Works as expected. Great!

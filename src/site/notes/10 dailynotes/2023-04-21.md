_Drum rolls, please..._ Re-publication of this website from the newly duplicated iCloud Obsidian vault `EricLiao` was a complete success, absolutely without any difficult. Steps involved:
* See [[10 dailynotes/2023-04-20\|2023-04-20]] for steps of setting up a new iPhone Obsidian vault to live on [[iCloud\|iCloud]]
* Re-install the [[Digital Garden plugin\|Digital Garden plugin]] and adjust settings (most of the options were really duplicated when I audaciously copied the .obsidian setting files)
* Nothing needs changing on the [[programming/MacOS Shell\|Github]]  and [[Web publishing with Obsidian + Github + Netlify\|Netlify]] sides. So simple!
* And _voil√†_!
I am so impressed by the smooth design of Obsidian/iCloud. With this completely free option, why would anyone pay for the $10/month, $96/year [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) service?

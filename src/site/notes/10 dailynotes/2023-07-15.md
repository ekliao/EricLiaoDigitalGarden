# PKM system longevity

[[Roam Research\|Roam Research]] is on the decline, I heard through the Danny/Dario/Bas [grapevine](https://www.youtube.com/live/zQ-ySSXR2ns?feature=share&t=5885) Worth watching their predictions about longevity for Obsidian, Logseq, Notion, Roam, Tana, etc.

# Sharing content between Obsidian and Logseq

2023-07-15: I had a brief scare of this horrible cohabitation for one hour. Found it messed up my website (with lots of trash backup files). Had to pull the plug. Luckily, clearing cache on Logseq magically removed the vault reference in it without deleting any of my OB stuff.

- Tags: #Logseq, #Obsidian, #OB-LQ
- URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKgCwzNTWWc

### Page Comment  
- Sad. Bas confirms that OB block references won't carry over into LQ, which I witnessed myself when viewing stuff created in OB on LQ: it's gone!Â   
- My thought: Since I have enough pages in OB, I should keep them and not transfer to LQ, but in LQ create native LQ pages/blocks and mark them as such clearly, so that each page/note is either OB or LQ, so that in LQ I won't be disappointed if OB block links don't show.

### Highlights & Notes
- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKgCwzNTWWc&t=0s)) if you're using Logseq and obsidian side by side this question becomes a bit moot because the way internal blocks are linked doesn't transfer well as i found out using Obsidian for months and going back to Logseq as a result you're probably better off using pages for everything. ==No, I won't use pages for everything.

Learn about Logseq's block writing and reference philosophy. It may be a game changer for me.

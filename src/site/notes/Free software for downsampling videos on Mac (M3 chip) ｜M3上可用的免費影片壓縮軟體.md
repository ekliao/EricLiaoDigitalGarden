Since the shocking yet understandable finding that I lost both [[Movavi Video Editor Plus 2020\|Movavi Video Editor Plus 2020]] and [[Movavi Video Editor 4\|Movavi Video Editor 4]] as two oft-used video editors after upgrading from an [[Mid-2014 MacBook Pro\|Intel-based MacBook Pro]] to a [[MacBook 2023 Pro Max, 16 inch, with the M3 chip upgrade log｜新購Mac筆電從Intel版狂升到M3晶片：綜合心得紀錄\|MacBook Pro Max M3]], one urgent task is to find alternative video editing software. While it takes time to look for a powerhouse program (like Apple's own Final Cut Pro) and evaluate its suitability, I am glad to learn how to downsample a huge raw video using at least three free tools:

自從升級M3筆電發現無法再用Movavi編輯、壓縮影片後，慶幸發現至少三個免費軟體都可實現效果不錯的影片壓縮：
# Free alternatives

## VLC Video Player

File > Convert/stream. This has the most versatile options. You enter your own numeric values in bit rate, frame rate, width x height, etc.
## iMovie

File > share > file > resolution/quality/speed. About 20 combinations.
## Quicktime

File > Export As. At least it downsamples its own .mov video format. Options seem limited to five: 4K, 1024p, 720p, 480p, and audio only.
# Light editing

Of the three, only iMovie is also a light-weight video editor, allowing for simple editing such as trimming. It has many video/audio effects but I haven't tried any or learned how. One nice thing: it shows audio clipping (when the audio level is high enough to be grating) graphically (but I haven't learned how to fix it).

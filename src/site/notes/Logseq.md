##### Highlights & Notes
- ([00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g66G2ThmC7M&t=58s)) you use normal brackets and then you search for something. the main issue that you'll start hitting here quickly is that you make a lot more lines than pages so searching this way isn't the most efficient way of getting towards your point. uh one of the main ways is just copy and paste and logseq is very much attuned to this so if I go to this example page where my made earlier is if I copy so I press Ctrl C you see block ref copied in the corner. 
	- Notes: 2 ways to refer to a block
		- (1) search for name like in OB: becomes hard as number of blocks grows; 
		- (2) ctrl-c (in target block) to generate a block ID; paste (in referring block) to refer to it; can rename 
- press Ctrl-e and then it says a block embed copied. so let's go back here do a paste and exactly what we expected a complete block references
	- Note: to embed (all children blocks): ctrl-e in target block, or do /embed in embedding block.
	- CAREFUL: changes can be made directly from the embedding block, including removing content! (diff behavior from OB)
		- To properly remove the embed, remove the embed code by ctrl-A (select all) and delete.
- (06:15) [[interstitial journaling\|interstitial journaling]] (kind of): put timestamp before a block ref. so, this means block ref doesn't necessarily always have to occupy the whole block in the referring block, or begin a block.

##### Highlights & Notes
- ([02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7yVdh7ITvz4&t=161s)) bullet threading plugin and it's actually a small CSS hack that came from a different theme but they put it in a plug-in and everybody keeps asking me about this because it's super useful so if you install it what it does is it adds this line when you're working on a 03:15 piece of text showing you which elements are the parents for that line and that's super useful because if I Mark in this example the top one with hashtag idea I don't need to do that for the line two down because both will come back in the hashtag ID page it's one of those ease of life things that I think should just be in lock seek by default
###### Many more plugins I've since added!

The prescription sleeping aid Lendormin disappoints for the first time. I took a full pill, expecting to sleep eight hours from 5:30AM. Yet. I woke up in 4.5 hours, anxious, unable to go back to sleep. ðŸ˜­ Next, at 4PM, I have a minimum 13-hour deposition job to do. Will likely be running on fume again past midnight.

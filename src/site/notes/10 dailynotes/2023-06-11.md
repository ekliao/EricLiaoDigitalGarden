# Data migration note: Apple Notes into Obsidian
#data/migration
#AppleNotes 

I did a dump using [[Exporter\|Exporter]] and put the results in this OB folder: `AppleNotes archive (Exporter dump)`.

Treat this data as experimental and read-only, for search and exploration. ==Don't change the content in any meaningful way== because the original copy still lives live in Apple Notes. The whole folder may be deleted and reimported, or cleaned up in some way.

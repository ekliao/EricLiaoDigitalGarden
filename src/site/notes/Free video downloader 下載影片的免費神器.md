# 4K Video Downloader

For downloading YouTube and [[Bilibili\|Bilibili]] videos (I haven't tried it on other platforms; Vimeo and Facebook are next) this tool is pure heavenly bliss! It beats [[Yout\|Yout]] (slow, daily limit to only 3 videos) and the shady [[Clipconverter.cc\|Clipconverter.cc]] by a mile. The free account gives you an abundant daily limit of 30 videos, and the download speed is the fastest of all tools I've tried.

## Vimeo and Facebook too

I tried downloading a public Vimeo video for the first time. It worked! I began to wonder whether any publicly viewable videos with a direct URL are downloadable. I proceeded to try a Facebook video. Boom! That worked too.

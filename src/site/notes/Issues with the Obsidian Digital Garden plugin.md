- The Publication Status popup becomes sluggish after 100+ notes in the published garden, taking some 15-20 seconds to show updated counts. But, clicking ahead on the buttons to publish new and changed notes before seeing the final count *does* seem to have an effect. Keep doing this but keep watch.

- ü§∑ Any Glasp URL don't work as links. The html URL is exposed raw. Not a disaster, just ungainly and inconvenient.

Hello? It's 2023, not 1990s any more! It's no longer a time when Unicode just emerged and gradually heading towards its eventual domination over entire world of web, driving out legacy encodings like Big5. Non-Unicode-aware websites and search functionality have NO PLACE in this world!

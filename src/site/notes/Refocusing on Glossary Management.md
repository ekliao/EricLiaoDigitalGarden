# Barking up the wrong tree

Yesterday, I focused all my energy on experimenting with creating a glossary management system using Supertags in Tana, the latest and greatest PKM that's all the rage. I hit the wall very quickly. ***Doing is believing. By actually doing it, I realized that Tana's template/database approach suffers these serious problems:

- Cumbersome entry
- Slow lookup
- Unnecessary complexity
- Questionable ability at best for bulk import (say, 1.2 million record)

I am sure Logseq is in the same quandary. Notion? Don't know, but since it is in the same category of app, I figure it's about the same.

Obsidian is hopeful, with its relaxed and versatile search using keywords like file, section, block, line, and regex on everything.

Then I realized that I've not really given Anki a proper evaluation for its custom fields. It does have those things. I finally get it.

So, I am sharing with whoever interested in glossary management this ongoing evaluation: 

[Glossary/terminology management and lookup app comparison and evaluation](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MxtXcajosk5Rc4bDptNOGm9BFl7Jc0US02rpt0LybWA/edit?usp=sharing)

I'm re-focusing solely on glossary/terminology concerns, not note-taking or publishing.

The major criteria now are:

- Custom fields
- Bulk entry or import/export
- Ease of
	- Single entry creation
	- Single entry update
- Searching by fields
- Speed of search

On first blush, the tried-and-true old friend Anki actually fits the bill perfectly.

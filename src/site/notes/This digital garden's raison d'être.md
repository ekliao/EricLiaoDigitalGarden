To put this website in context, I love [Andy Matuschak](https://andymatuschak.org/)'s idea of thinking and writing notes for the self, disregarding the audience. This resonates with how I feel all along when blogging became a thing in the early 2000s. I intuitively agree that this way of presenting oneself to the world "creates more invested, interesting followings over the long term." See below also for his insights:

Such a powerful message. Love it! Quoting all, spreading it, putting it on my digital garden. 

### Highlights & Notes

- One of my favorite ways that creative people communicate is by “working with their garage door up,” to riff on a passage from Robin Sloan (below). This is the opposite of the Twitter account which mostly posts announcements of finished work: it’s [Screenshot Saturday](https://twitter.com/hashtag/screenshotsaturday?lang=en); it’s giving a lecture about the problems you’re pondering in the shower; it’s thinking out loud about the ways in which your project doesn’t work at all. It’s so much of Twitch. I want to see the process. I want to see you trim the artichoke. I want to see you choose the color palette. [Anti-marketing](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS).

* I love this kind of communication personally, but I suspect it also creates more invested, interesting followings over the long term. That effect’s probably related to [Working on niche, personally-meaningful projects brings weirder, more serendipitous inbounds](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/z2DABWsGLkXcCuUet2scfD1duL1ZHBztwGKp). It’s also a way to avoid the problems described in [Pitching out corrupts within](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/zqG92bvaL58AWMeL97jXaRd1Dm6hsfGvhAn).

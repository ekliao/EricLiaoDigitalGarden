# Issues

## [[Always opening the last opened vault\|Always opening the last opened vault]]
- Unlike the desktop app that allows one to start Obsidian and open any vault from the menu, the iOS app insists on opening the vault it thinks it worked with last, potentially hanging if the vault has been stuck in iCloud hell, never giving the opportunity to switch to a working vault.
- Solution: When push comes to shove, see this solution:

## Hanging during initialization/iCloud syncing configuration
- Solution: Simply delete the app. Data and vaults on iCloud won't be affected. Reinstall the app and it'll recognize all vaults in iCloud. You'll get a reset in everything but vault settings and plugins are intact.

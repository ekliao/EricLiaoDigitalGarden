DTTG for short.

A strong candidate as my one and only [[Glossary Lookup\|Glossary Lookup]] tool.

Here's a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KYo6L0gdGnY) by a Chinese YouTuber that opened my eyes.
- Search interface
- Adding ABBYY app's OCR result instantly to DTTG
- Has iCloud sync
- Chinese search (dependent on good Chinese word segmentation) iffy. Could be a showstopper.

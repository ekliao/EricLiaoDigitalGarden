This is one of my [[Glossary Lookup\|candidates]] for being the permanent, one-and-only glossary lookup tool. I have an account from to educator status. More reason to take advantage of it. Interpreter's Help (IH for short) is the closest among the candidates to InterpretBank, so both get extra consideration for having design facilitating the ease of quick lookup and sharing.

# Deal Breaker

- Currently (2023-05-17) search using Chinese characters doesn't work in the global search interface combining all glossaries (but work in single glossary). I've contacted the creator of IH months ago, who confirmed he could duplicate the issue I reported. As he was working on a new version, he said the defect will be fixed in the new release.

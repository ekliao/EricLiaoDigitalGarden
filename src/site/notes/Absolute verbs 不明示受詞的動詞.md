#grammar 
- discuss
>(AHD5) _v.intr._
**1.** To speak with another or others about something: _As we discussed yesterday, the problem could have more than one solution._
**2.** To examine or consider a subject in speech or writing.
**3.** To come to an agreement as a result of a discussion: _As we discussed, you will clean your room before going out._

A colleague just said `We will discuss on <topic>.` in an open communication. This made me do a double take and reach for [[Eudic 歐路詞典\|Eudic 歐路詞典]] in curiosity. I'm relieved that no, one does not say `discuss on sth`.

But here's an unintended discovery: I found the above intransitive senses for `discuss` by AHD5 most peculiar. The fact that no other dictionaries have such a treatment is worthy of research.

For senses 1 and 3, I suspect the object is implicit in `as` (I forgot the proper terminology for this usage. Relative something...). If that's the case, `discuss` is still transitive. For 2, I would like to see an example.

Then, happily, the answer quickly came to those who care enough to look.

- Title:  'Discuss' Transitive Vs Intransitive Verb?
- URL: https://www.englishforums.com/English/DiscussTransitiveIntransitive-Verb/chcdp/post.htm

### Highlights & Notes
- When an obligatorily transitive verb is used this way, it is called "an absolute verb". Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary explains it as follows in the entry of "absolute".  "absolute" of a verb : having no object in the particular construction under consideration though normally transitive. \<Kill\> in "if looks could kill" is an absolute verb.

- absolute

>(AHD5) grammar
 b. Of, relating to, or being a transitive verb when its object is implied but not stated. For example, _inspires_ in _We have a teacher who inspires_ is an absolute verb.

>(M-W) grammar
 Of a verb : having no object in the particular construction under consideration though normally transitive
 **_Kill_** in "if looks could kill" is an absolute verb.

>(NODE3) grammar
 (Of a transitive verb) used without an expressed object (e.g. guns kill).
 Verbs grouped as absolute, relative, or nounal.

### Conclusion

With the clearly defined "absolute verbs," it's all clear now. Whether to define intransitive `discuss` and `kill` is a judgment call: [[AHD5\|AHD5]] errs on the side of redundancy to the systematic rule of absolute verbs while other dictionaries choose brevity.

### Page Comment  
- Sad. Bas confirms that OB block references won't carry over into LQ, which I witnessed myself when viewing stuff created in OB on LQ: it's gone!Â   
- My thought: Since I have enough pages in OB, I should keep them and not transfer to LQ, but in LQ create native LQ pages/blocks and mark them as such clearly, so that each page/note is either OB or LQ, so that in LQ I won't be disappointed if OB block links don't show.

### Highlights & Notes
- ([00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CKgCwzNTWWc&t=0s)) if you're using Logseq and obsidian side by side this question becomes a bit moot because the way internal blocks are linked doesn't transfer well as i found out using Obsidian for months and going back to Logseq as a result you're probably better off using pages for everything. ==No, I won't use pages for everything.

# Todo: Understand the philosophy of Logseq
#todo 
Learn about Logseq's block writing and reference philosophy. It may be a game changer for me. Watch and study [Dario's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZtRozP8hfEY) carefully, and go back to [Bas's video].

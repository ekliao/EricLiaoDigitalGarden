**alethic modality**
[src](https://www.eltconcourse.com/training/inservice/modality/types_of_modality.html)
This term derives from the Greek word for _truth_ [_αλήθεια, aleethia_] and refers to _logical necessity_ (rather than deduction which concerns epistemic modality).  For example, the use of _must_ in:  
    _A square must have four sides_refers not to the speaker's perception and not to any form of obligation, ability or deduction but to the fact that one of the necessary conditions of being a square is to have four sides and the use of _can't_ in:  
    _Parallel lines can't meet_  
equally represents the truth of a proposition, failing which the lines cannot be parallel.  A few modal auxiliary verbs  (_must, can't, will, mustn't_ and _need_ mostly) fall into this category as does the present simple tense form of the verb and other expressions such as:  
    _A defining characteristic of squares is that they have four equal sides  
    Lines which are parallel never meet_In a sense, this form of modality is the odd one out because it does not rely on the speaker's view of an event or state.  Alethic modality is concerned with what is universally true in all cases independent of the setting.

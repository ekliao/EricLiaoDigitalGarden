#rating 
## Quick Verdict: 3.5 stars

Easy to use, especially as a replacement of Evernote and for creating tags, but it is a very closed system with kinks. See under Cons.

## Pros
- Superb sync across all Apple devices
- Smart tags
- Quick notes
## Cons
- [[Apple Notes disinteroperability\|Apple Notes disinteroperability]]

A: The phrase "我都有說嘍！" can have different interpretations depending on the context and tone of the speaker. However, in general, it can be translated into English as:

"I've already said it!" or "I've told you already!"

The tone of the phrase suggests that the speaker is frustrated or annoyed that their message or opinion has not been understood or acknowledged. The use of the particle "嘍" (lō) at the end of the sentence is a colloquial expression commonly used in Taiwanese Mandarin that adds a sense of playfulness or emphasis to the statement.

In terms of tone and attitude, there is a subtle difference between "我都有說喔！" and "我都有說嘍！". 

The phrase "我都有說喔！" implies a more neutral or matter-of-fact tone. The use of the particle "喔" (ō) at the end of the sentence is a common expression in Mandarin Chinese that signals the speaker is providing new information or emphasizing a point. The tone of this phrase suggests that the speaker is simply stating a fact, rather than expressing any particular emotion or frustration.

On the other hand, the phrase "我都有說嘍！" has a more playful or teasing tone. The use of the particle "嘍" (lō) at the end of the sentence is a colloquial expression in Taiwanese Mandarin that adds a sense of playfulness or emphasis to the statement. This tone suggests that the speaker is either amused or slightly exasperated by the situation, but is not necessarily angry or upset.

Overall, the difference in tone and attitude between these two phrases is subtle, but can be inferred from the use of different particles and the overall context in which they are used.

"我都有說喔！" can be translated to English as "I have already said it, you know!" or "I've already mentioned it!"

"我都有說嘍！" can be translated to English as "I've already said it, you know!" with a playful or teasing tone, or "I've already said it, come on!" with a slightly exasperated tone.

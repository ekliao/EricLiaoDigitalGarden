### Page Comment

- great. so, OB has this too through plugins: relevance. competes w Mem X/Mem.ai at least partially. Is this plugin free?

ChatGPT / OpenAI plugins:
- Smart Connections.

Requires API key (OpenAI).

Todo: find out if the API key is free.

Files: relevant notes

Chat: the example given makes it seem dumb, compared to Mem. Requires some kind of syntax/link.

### Highlights & Notes

- ([01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=msnZjiZrSXs&t=109s)) smart connections files this is where it goes through your Vault and it scans through your files and this is great because instead of using maybe one of the other options where you go through and you 02:25 look at your your different backlinks or your unlinked mentions this particular plugin goes a bit deeper so I've gone in and I have selected on the icon for smart connection files there's two of them but we'll focus on this one for now and we can see automatically and if this is your first time you will see it generate this go through and do the scan and kind of generate this type of information but I've been using it for a little bit here so it's already found information within my Vault that's relevant to this 03:01 particular note this is really fast and this really gives you some good insights without you having to manually do anything to your to your Vault or the notes within your Vault to make these different notes linked together it goes through itself and it uses the AI to you know bring up these different references and what the AI think is relevant to this this note within this list now right now the default setting us to have them all expanded

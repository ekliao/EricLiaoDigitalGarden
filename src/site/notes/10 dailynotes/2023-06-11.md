# Data migration: Apple Notes into Obsidian
#data/migration
#AppleNotes 
#readonly

I did an experimental data dump using [[Exporter (app)\|../Exporter (app)]] and put the results in this OB folder: `ReadOnly - AppleNotes archive (Exporter dump)`.

Treat this data as experimental and read-only, for search and exploration. ==Don't change the content in any meaningful way== because the original copy still lives live in Apple Notes. The whole folder may be deleted and reimported, or cleaned up in some way.

*Update 2023-06-20* I did find a note through tags and search, and naturally I wanted to change it. Go ahead. But ==always dispose of the corresponding Apple Notes right away.==

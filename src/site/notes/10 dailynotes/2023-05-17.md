# Hearing loudly and clearly

</div>



# The holy grail of hearing aid?

*(2023-05-17)* I ordered—based on product info, a live phone chat with customer support, and most importantly, faith—a microphone designed for court reporters for enhanced pickup of human speech voice and reduced room noise. At almost $200 a pop, it ought to produce some magic, right? I am a skeptic when it comes to product advertising, so I'll wait until I get to taste the pudding before passing judgment. Next week I have an almost full week of full-day court gigs including a trial from a new neighbor county. I am hopeful about improved hearing than offered by the two humble sets of basic lavalier mics I have, but entertain no delusions for miracles.

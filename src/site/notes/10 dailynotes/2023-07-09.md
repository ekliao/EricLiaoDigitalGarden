## Debugging Perl 6 books while learning

#### Spotted confusing errors from the "parsing" book

## Errata

* *(2023-07-09)* The following factual errors are very unfortunate when I am trying to unravel this whitespace tangle. 

If the predefined `<ws>` construct is equivalent in code as
```
regex ws { <!ww> \s*}
```
then clearly it matches **zero to many** different whitespace characters unless it's **within a word**. The two fatal errors are: =="at least one"== and =="unless it's at a word boundary"==.

#### Even more shocking errors from the "learning" book

## Errata
* *(2023-07-09)* After spotting two bad errors regarding `<ws>` in the [[book - Parsing With Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars, 2017, Moritz Lenz, Apress\|book - Parsing With Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars, 2017, Moritz Lenz, Apress]] book, I tried to look for and expected clarity in guidance from this book. Instead, I found what appears to be more confusing errors and terribly imprecise misused language.

First, `<|wb>`, according to [official documentation](https://docs.raku.org/language/regexes#Word_boundary), is wrong. It should be

`<?wb>` or the hard-to-understand `<|w>`.

Second, the comment "required between word characters, optional otherwise" is just plain wrong. It's confusing language. A word character should be \[a-zA-Z0-9_\] or any Unicode letter. If we take "Hello world!", "between word characters" therefore would mean any point where I added a \^:

`H^e^l^l^o w^o^r^l^d!`

Those points aren't places where whitespace is required. Quite the opposite.

What the author means to say is "between words" or more verbosely, "between a word character and a non-word character." If we ignore both ends, there are exactly two points where `<ws>` can occur:

`Hello^world^!`

In terms of confusing writing, seriously I'm appalled, but one instance is forgivable. Will watch out for more.

耐人尋味的訪問片段

「人機合一」，怎麼合？盡在不言中。是指同步口譯、逐步口譯工作的當下，還是事前準備？如光指事前準備，「合一」的說法則過於美化機器的角色。

This is quite an interesting interview of an interpreter in Taiwan, on the topic of AI. What's hinted at behind the expression "人機合一" (the human interpreter and the machine working as one) is tantalizing, but any details were glossed over with a facile "各憑本事" (each doing what they can). *smirk*

但是，我經常遭受口譯工作時收音不良之苦，不得不「黜臭」（華星文=吐槽）一下：這個節目收音品質太差，人聲聽得出扭曲失真（似乎是所選麥克風使然，而非後製時搞砸的），加上小房間回音，折磨聽眾耳朵。

But as someone who suffers too often from bad source audio during an interpreting assignment, I need to point out the interviewer failed in getting the sound right. The speech voice is distorted (sounds like a feature of the microphone used, less of a botched post-production) and further degraded by too much room reverb. Toxic audio tortures!

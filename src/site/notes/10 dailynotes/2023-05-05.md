### The snag of slug

After yesterday's Anki-to-Obsidian migration of 25,000 notes, I am starting to feel the sluggishness. The constant progress bar for loading, indexing and searching is irksome. Search is the most impacted.

On a positive note, there are people reporting vaults with 80K, 100K, even 280K files/notes. The 280K guy reported unbearable slowness. At the 100k level, OB seems still usable. But this means I should not even entertain migrating all of Anki's read-only notes, which constitutes the bulk.

An insight offered: use a different tool for search, such as [DEVONthink](https://www.devontechnologies.com/apps/devonthink).

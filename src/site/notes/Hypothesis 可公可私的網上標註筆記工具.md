A flexible online reading, highlighting, note-taking, and sharing app. What sets it apart from [[Omnivore - an open-source, free Readwise Reader alternative 免費的閱讀筆記書籤軟體\|Omnivore]] and [[Glasp\|Glasp]] is that you get to control each note's visibility: by default all notes are public and published, but you can make a note private, viewable to you only by creating it in a private group or setting it to "to me only" in a (default) public group. I tested this and it really works as claimed. 

Anyone can read a public note without a Hypothesis account.

# Finder
- I had iCloud under Favorite in Finder but one day it went missing!
	- If missing, moved (by accident):
		- use ***SHIFT-CMD-I*** to bring it back
		- New Finder
			- Preference > Sidebar
				- Check iCloud
			- iCloud appears in Sidebar
			- Move it under Favorite if you like
# Sync
- Sooooooo S--L---O------WWWWW.
Took 2 full days to sync 500K files.
# Obsidian
- iCloud is the suspect in constant Obsidian indexing: [Thread](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-keeps-indexing-my-vault/30636)

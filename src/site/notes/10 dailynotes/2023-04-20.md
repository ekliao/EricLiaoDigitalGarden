### How to sync an Obsidian vault between MacOS desktop and iOS for free
{ #b836ee}


I figured out how to do this. The key is *creating a new vault on the iOS device, not on desktop*, and then migrating existing content to it. Steps:
1. Say you have a non-[[iCloud\|iCloud]] vault on the [[MacOS\|MacOS]] desktop called `ABC`
2. Create a new vault called `ABC` on iOS's Obsidian app
3. When prompted, choose to link it to [[iCloud\|iCloud]] (irreversible)
4. On the desktop, see the iCloud Obsidian folder `ABC`
5. Copy everything under desktop folder `ABC` including all hidden files (under `.obsidian`) to the new iCloud vault `ABC`
6. Wait a while for iCloud to sync automatically, and verify all content now appears on the iOS device's `ABC` Obsidian vault

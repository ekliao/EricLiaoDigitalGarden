For the first time, I almost used up Otter.ai's monthly allowance of transcription time. There's less than 5 hours left with 3 days to go. I feel I'm finally getting the bang for my buck.

I am one of the early paid subscribers who still enjoy 100 hours of monthly usage. Since Otter added an AI component, it has undercut monthly usage by more than 50%
for newer subscribers. I am not forever grandfathered; my usage will reduce per the new policy in 1.5 years in April 2025.

# Pros

- One of the best English AI transcribers there are in terms of accuracy and speed.
- Auto speaker identification
- Annotation/comments
- Highlighting
- The transcription can be edited.
# Cons

- Search using the date range does not work.
- Comments are not searchable like the transcription itself.
- Supports English only. Seriously?
- Greatly reduced usage especially imports (see update 2024-05-18 below)
- Interferes with browser-based RSI interpretation apps

# Update *2024-05-18*

I am almost done with Otter.ai. The new pricing model makes it no longer a viable tool for me. At $120/year, it now only allows 20 hours a month, 90 minute each, and limits upload of 10 files per month. The last limitation is ridiculous. It used to allow 100 hours (6000 minutes) per month and up to 4 hours per recording or crying out loud!

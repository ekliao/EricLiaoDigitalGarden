## History
- *(2023-05-05)* I don't mean to be harsh. This seems so juvenile and limiting because it only works within the the single note that's open, and it performs only _replace_; you can't just do a _find_. Also, it shows only the number of replacements made in a fleeting popup but doesn't highlight anything being replaced in place. I've never seen such immature UI. Beware!

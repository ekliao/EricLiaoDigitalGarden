#obsolete 
Bought this app, which seems popular with Chinese users, for $30 on the iPad some three years ago in order to even be able to try it, but it ended up only a glancing try. I was immediately turned off by the bloated size of its exports.

Played with it for a day or two. Found the file size it produced prohibitively gigantic (think it was 2GB for a 300MB scanned PDF file). Now, it's deservedly neglected, lying somewhere on my large old iPad taking up precious storage space. 

I heard it has evolved a lot though. Should I give it another chance now with my new understanding of PKM?

# VLC Player

- Seems fastest of all method I've tried
- High compression rate!
- Just choose scale ratio to be 1, 0.75, 0.5, or 0.25, then "SAVE" and it'll start compressing. Keep bitrate and frame rates at 0.

# Movavi video editor 24 (MVE24)
- Second in speed. Definitely slower than VLC Player. Compression rate not as good as VLC either.
# Movavi screen recorder 24 (MCR24)
- Slower than MVE24.
# QuickTime
- Performance and speed not sure.

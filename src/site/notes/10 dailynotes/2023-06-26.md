It's interesting to observe how convenience continues to shape our behavior. Before, when I used my old and faithful Lenovo standard US 101-key keyboard, I used the larger `backspace` key almost exclusively to delete something backwardly when editing. It is easy to reach, sitting at the top right corner of the main region of the keyboard, so it practically screams "press me, press me"!

Now, I have warmed up to my new [[Nuphy Air75 (mechanical wireless multi-device keyboard)\|Nuphy Air75 (mechanical wireless multi-device keyboard)]], which has the `delete` key sitting at the top right corder of the entire keyboard. It occupies one of the three top spots (the other two being the `space` key and the top-left `escape` key), so as far as access goes, it wins over the `backspace` key, which is right under the `screenshot` key and the `scroll` key. For numerous times, I wanted to `backspace` but found the cross-hair cursor on my screen, and realized I had accidentally press the `screenshot` key again. This conditioning has changed my habit over a few weeks. Besides it being more accessible, I now find the `delete` key more straightforward in principle, as it deletes forward from the cursor, than the `backspace` key.

Of course, during typing and writing, the `backspace` key remains the go-to key for immediately deleting the last letter typed incorrectly. But, during editing or reviewing, the default action is to position the cursor *before* the bad letter and press `delete`.

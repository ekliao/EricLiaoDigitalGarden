# I've given up using Logseq block properties, templates, and live queries for building mini databases

After trying this apparently sensible and attractive approach for about two weeks, mainly with logging audio summary of books, I think it's time to give up. The reason being, the UI has too much friction for establishing a good new habit of creating a mini database on Logseq. The query feels iffy and overly complicated. The logging and recording of new "records" is scattered in various daily journals. This is a new way I'm willing to try, but if the UI doesn't feel robust and reliable, I am afraid of not finding things that should be found.

This is not just about information anxiety. It's not just mental. It can negatively affect work and productivity.

Instead, I am relapsing to the old and simple way of tracking using [[Evernote\|Evernote]] and tags. For one thing, Evernote, despite it having fallen on a hard time, is robust and fast enough.

Like I have said recently in other notes, I think Logseq has a problem with speed and reliability. I am honestly quite disappointed at it for feeling like a play thing and not a robust piece of software.

It's not that I don't want to look for new solutions and form new habits, it's that a new solution has to be relatively frictionless and robust to gain my trust. In that regard, Obsidian feels right, but Logseq does not.

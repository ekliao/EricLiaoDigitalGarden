A flexible online highlighting, note-taking, and sharing app. What sets it apart from [[Omnivore - an open-source, free Readwise Reader alternative 免費的閱讀筆記書籤軟體\|Omnivore]] and [[Glasp\|Glasp]] is that you get to control each note's visibility: by default all notes are public and published, but you can make a note private, viewable to you only, by either creating it in a private group or setting it to "to me only" in a (default) public group. I tested this and it works as claimed. 

Anyone can read and search for a public note without a Hypothesis account. 

Hypothesis doesn't compete head-on with [[Omnivore - an open-source, free Readwise Reader alternative 免費的閱讀筆記書籤軟體\|Omnivore]] because it isn't also a reading app, but in my opinion it kind of eats [[Glasp\|Glasp]]'s lunch simply by having a functioning [[Obsidian plugin - Hypothesis\|Obsidian plugin]] that syncs to Obsidian, like Omnivore does. However, Glasp uniquely offers a very cool capability of video annotations for YouTube.

This tool seems rather popular with teachers and students because it integrates with learning management platforms like [[Canvas\|Canvas]].
# Quick verdict: 4.5 stars 強力推薦
## Pros

- Free
- Open source
- Flexibility in access control: a public note by default can be set to private
- No account or login required to read anyone's public notes
- Simple RTF (rich text formatting) in comments; allows pictures and links
- Obsidian integration
- Searching is top-notch
- Said to comply with annotation "standards"
- More convenient in-place (the web page) quick highlighting and noting action than Omnivore, which is a reading app first, requiring adding the web page to collection before highlighting/noting is possible.
## Cons

- Updated annotations don't sync successfully to Obsidian the way Omnivore does. A tedious workaround: delete the Obsidian note, reset (in plugin setting), and sync again.
- Caution: can reveal private web content (the highlighted portion) if the note is set to public
- No iOS app; web-based
- The suggested solution for iOS (loading through via.hypothes.is) is crappy and practically useless.
- Not also a reading app like Omnivore 
- Certain web domains aren't enabled; similar limitations as Glasp, more limited than Omnivore
- Loading of the annotation UI (after clicking the Chrome button on a web page) can be a bit iffy

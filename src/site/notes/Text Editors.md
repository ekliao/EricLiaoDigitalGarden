## EmEditor
{ #81cbb4}


[EmEditor](https://www.emeditor.com/) remains my favorite text editor, not just one of, but the no. 1 for me. Unfortunately it lives only on [[Windows\|Windows]].

## CotEditor
Two days ago (2/23/23) I found [[CotEditor\|CotEditor]]. I had briefly tried it and uninstalled it because I didn't look hard enough to find out it has much better [[Regex 正則表示式\|Regex 正則表示式]] support than [[Sublime Text\|Sublime Text]]. It recognizes, *drum rolls please*, ``\p{Han}`` for [[Chinese characters\|Chinese characters]]!

#### Sublime Text
I make do with [[Sublime Text\|Sublime Text]] on [[MacOS\|MacOS]] but its interface seems lame especially for [[Regex 正則表示式\|Regex 正則表示式]] search and replace. CotEditor has made this obsolete.

## [UltraEdit for Mac](https://www.ultraedit.com/products/mac-text-editor/)
I am coveting this famous Windows editor for its functionality of find & replace in multiple files in a directory recursively, lamentably missing in CotEditor. It is unfortunately expensive at $150 for a perpetual license.

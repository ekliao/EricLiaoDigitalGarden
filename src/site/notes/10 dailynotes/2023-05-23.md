# Comparing ChatGPT, Bing, and Bard

For a lark, I tried these three AI agents (all free) and asked about content farms, apropos of nothing. What are they? What are some famous CFs? How much money does a typical CF make? Has any CF been charged with crimes? Yadi yadi yada.

To my surprise, the most talked about ChatGPT fared the worst in being straight-laced and responding that as an AI model with a knowledge cutoff of 2021 it cannot give specific examples of CFs being charged with crimes.

On the other hand, Bing is the worst at making stuff up. It gleefully feeds you misinformation or irrelevant information about BP and Trump Organization, neither being a CF.

I'm delighted to find that the bot I am interacting with for the first time, Google's Bard, gave the most useful answer, and was also the fastest in generating responses.

Yes, there have been a few cases where content farm companies have been charged with crimes. In 2012, Demand Media was sued by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for making false and misleading claims about the quality of its content. The FTC alleged that Demand Media was using deceptive practices to generate traffic to its sites, including using fake reviews and creating content that was plagiarized or otherwise unoriginal. Demand Media settled the lawsuit without admitting any wrongdoing, but it agreed to pay a $1 million fine and to change its practices.

In 2014, Outbrain was sued by the FTC for engaging in deceptive advertising practices. The FTC alleged that Outbrain was using misleading language to describe its content recommendation platform, and that it was failing to disclose that it was paid by publishers to display certain content. Outbrain settled the lawsuit without admitting any wrongdoing, but it agreed to pay a $3 million fine and to change its practices.

These are just two examples of cases where content farm companies have been charged with crimes. While it is not common for content farm companies to be charged with crimes, it is something that can happen. It is important to be aware of the potential risks associated with content farms before using them.

Here are some of the potential risks associated with content farms:

- The content may be plagiarized or otherwise unoriginal.
- The content may be misleading or false.
- The content may be used to generate traffic to websites that are not legitimate.
- The content may be used to collect personal information from users.

It is important to be aware of these risks before using content farms. If you are unsure about the quality or authenticity of the content, it is best to avoid it.

Trying out [[Hypothesis - a public-by-default web annotation tool 預設公開的網上標註筆記工具\|Hypothesis]] as a tool to highlight and annotate random text I come across on the web. For example, here are my [notes](https://hyp.is/Vvn78oNNEe6cL_-XFkmsOA/www.books.com.tw/products/0010973855)， in Chinese, for an interesting title, *The Chinese Typewriter*. 

Here's a screenshot of what the web note should look like, after loading, using a computer (the view on a smartphone or tablet may be different and limited):

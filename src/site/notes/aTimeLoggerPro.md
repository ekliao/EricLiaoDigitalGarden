## Quick verdict: 3 stars

I started using this time logging app on Android and later moved to iOS. I used it extensively to track actual time: exam prep, work, etc. Later, I found a "ingenious" use: track instances of an event rather than duration. I call it "punctual" use.

I upgraded from Basic to the Pro version in 2022. Generally speaking, it's useful, there are a few cons that relate to poor software development skills in my opinion.

## Cons
- On the iPhone, often the buttons for start/pause/stop don't respond accurately, resulting in continued counting when I had meant for a task to stop. This is a frequent issue.
- Adding the Apple Watch to the mix makes the situation worse. The same problem can be observed and I chalk it down as a broader issue of bad design in sync between the cloud and the local apps on iOS and WatchOS.

### The sync problem: an example

- iPhone app showing no active time-tracking (of the wine quarter glass):

- But, the Watch may show that the app is tracking time (at 4:35, as shown):

- Clicking into the app on the Watch confirms the tracing:

## Remedy

Most of the time, simply stopping the tracking on the Watch will do. To err on the side of caution, double-check on the iPhone app that no new tracking entry is recorded.

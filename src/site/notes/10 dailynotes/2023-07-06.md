# Sight translation and the anatomy of a legalese sentence
{ #354fda}


## tl;dr: **"Failure of proof by X"** simply means **"X failed to prove something"**.

### 順句驅動固然是視譯不可或缺的技能，但如果原文理解不對，再怎麼順句驅動也枉然。

There are four instances of "failure of proof by X" in the source English text, as highlighted in color in the screenshot. In each, the noun phrase simply means X has failed to prove something. 

Yet, the meaning of this has generated quite a bit of confusion among some classmates in the sight translation course took. Here's my take and my own sight translation of the sentence. I hope this helps fellow classmates in either affirming their confidence of their original comprehension or righting their course if they had drifted afar.

以下是我對這句英文的理解，以及我順句驅動版的視譯，供有緣看到的同學參考。 XD

p.s. For those curious not about the English grammar but about the regex for finding the "failure of..." pattern, here it is:
`fail(s|ed|ing|ure)?\s*(, if any,\s*)?((of|to)\s*(proof|prove)\s+)?(on the part of|by|from|of)\s+the\s+(people|defen(se|dant))`

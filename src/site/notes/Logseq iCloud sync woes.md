Just witnessed how bad iCloud is: a completely unreliable service. It doesn't sync Logseq's small updates to journals and appears to get stuck. So, even though I've added content to today's journal (2023-07-30) from desktop, LQ opens the journal as empty on the iPhone, and as a result, a "2023-07-30 2" page is created.

### Highlights & Notes
- iCloud is buggy and unreliable. I would never trust it with anything important.
- Obsidian works great with iCloud, no idea why.
> Somehow, OB works rather well with iCloud better than LQ does. Is there something LQ dev has done wrong?

# Hacks that work for now

- Always pay attention to the content of daily journals.
- Restart wifi on phone and observe the iCloud files for sync progress.
- In Logseq menu, "refresh" the database.

#zoom-videoconferencing

I've wanted to test this for a long time. Glad to have the definitive results: This experiment is a success, using the free account, despite Zoom's false warnings to the contrary: it isn't good at updating its user interface to reflect the latest capability.
# Steps

1. The host should open breakout rooms before sharing.
2. Share a video (e.g. VLC Player app), and check "share sound" and "share to breakout rooms".
3. Get false warnings like "Your video and audio will NOT be shared with Breakout Rooms": ==Ignore it. It's not true.==
4. See another warning: Participants using older Zoom versions cannot hear the shared sound: ==This may well be true, so ask them to upgrade to the latest version.==

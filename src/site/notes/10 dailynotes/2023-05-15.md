## Writing as a habit
More and more, the daily notes, or what I glorified as “blog posts,” are getting shorter and their content insignificant, nothing more than capricious musings of the moment, like this very piece, just a bullet point. But, for a selfish reason, I'd rather keep writing short—and every day—than not write at all for fear of failing to produce more substantive, structured, well-thought-out pieces. Only through writing *anything* will I get a chance of exercising and checking the expressions I have lying dormant in me.

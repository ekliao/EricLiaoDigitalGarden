# Predicative expression - Wikipedia

### Metadata
- Title: Predicative expression - Wikipedia
- Tags: #grammar, #English
- URL: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Predicative_expression
### Page Comment
- Unambiguous distinction between "(clause) predicate" and "predicative (expression)", both nouns.

### Highlights & Notes
- A predicative expression (or just predicative) is part of a clause predicate, and is an expression that typically follows a copula or linking verb, e.g. be, seem, appear, or that appears as a second complement of a certain type of verb, e.g. call, make, name, etc.[1] The most frequently acknowledged types of predicative expressions are predicative adjectives (also predicate adjectives) and predicative nominals (also predicate nominals). The main trait of all predicative expressions is that they serve to express a property that is assigned to a "subject", whereby this subject is usually the clause subject
- The formulations "over the subject" and "over the object" indicate that the predicative expression is expressing a property that is assigned to the subject or to the object.

# Record It!

</div>



I purchased this app for about $10 in 2018, when I was trying to make screen recordings (with internal audio) on the iPad. I didn't know that iOS/iPadOS had a built-in tool to do this already. As soon as I discovered the system tool, I never used Record It! again.

That was a mistake. I now think this tool is a must-have for allowing users to change these three parameters of the recording:
- Resolution (360p to 1080p, or auto)
- Bitrate (1Mbps to 12Mbps, or auto)
- Frame rate (24fps to 60fps, or auto)

The built-in tool, not allowing any configuration, yields huge files in high resolution, easily 10GB per hour. But with Record It!, I sometimes use the lowest setting to produce a recording only a fraction in size, still clear enough to view and with perfect audio, when I don't need higher resolution or when I need only the audio. For example, 100MB-500MB per hour depending on how busy the screen action.

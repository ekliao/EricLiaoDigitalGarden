_Drum rolls, please..._ Re-publication of this website from the newly duplicated iCloud Obsidian vault `EricLiao` was a complete success, absolutely without any difficult. Steps involved:
1. See [[10 dailynotes/2023-04-20\|How to sync an Obsidian vault between MacOS desktop and iOS for free]] for steps of setting up a new iPhone Obsidian vault to live on [[iCloud (Drive)\|../iCloud (Drive)]] and migrate the old vault's content there.
2. Re-install the [Digital Garden plugin](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden) and adjust settings (most of the options were really duplicated when I audaciously copied the .obsidian setting files).
3. Nothing needs changing on the [[MacOS Shell Development Environment\|Github]] and [[Web publishing with Obsidian + Github + Netlify｜Obdisian 架站成功的做法\|Netlify]] sides. So simple!
4. And _voilà_!

I am so impressed by the seamless design of Obsidian/iCloud. With this completely free option, why would anyone pay for the $10/month or $96/year [Obsidian Sync](https://obsidian.md/sync) service?

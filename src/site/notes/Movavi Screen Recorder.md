## Issues
{ #ce9775}


- *2023-05-04*
Normally super dependable, able to record up to 7 hours of video without breaking. but alas, it failed to save a 1-hour important screen recording, a self documentation of the complicated process of using EmEditor to wrangle regex massaging Anki data into OB compliant or safe form in an spur-of-the-moment new project of migrating 20,000 Anki notes to Obsidian. The recorder had just successfully saved a 30-minute video of the same nature, with good Arctis sound, with setting of input mic=Arctis and no sys sound. No Loopback, as I switched between the Windows VM view and Mac, staying mostly on EmEditor. It gained my trust thus but now it has lost it big time. No, my computer did not run out of disk space. Still 180GB left.

Alternative: QuickTime (using Arctis as input mic again).

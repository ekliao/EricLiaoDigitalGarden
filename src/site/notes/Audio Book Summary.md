I admit that I am not an avid reader, not even a good one. But continuous acquisition of knowledge (or, as the marketing-minded folks like to call it, professional development, or PD) is crucial, so I developed the habit of learning by listening to not long-form audio books, but their CliffsNotes equivalentsâ€”book summaries in audio.

Below are a list of audio book summary apps I have on my phone.

I could not decide which ones or one to pay for because none are a one stop shop in terms of titles. So I ended up grazing and browsing for daily or occasional free titles. The serendipitous discovery of a good title can be fun, with zero pressure of having to keep up.

### Daily free titles
- [Blinkist](https://www.blinkist.com/)
	- I subscribed to this for a year and stopped because I couldn't find the time to fully justify the price, which arguably is rather modest for frequent listeners.
- [12min](https://12min.com/)
- [Instaread](https://instaread.co/)
### Non-daily free titles
- [4Books](https://4books.com/en)
- [StoryShots](https://www.getstoryshots.com/)
### Daily free teasers (incomplete summary)
- [Uptime](https://uptime.app/)

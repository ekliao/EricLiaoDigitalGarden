# Roget's Thesaurus

</div>



The famed [Roget's Thesaurus in Obsidian](https://publish.obsidian.md/rogets/TOC+-+Categories+(alternative)) is back online. It was inoperative for quite some time since Nick Milo raved about it in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qoY_TDS_DXs). See it and believe it before it goes off again. 🤣

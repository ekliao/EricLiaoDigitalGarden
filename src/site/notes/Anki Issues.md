Aiyaa! A dark day for Anki. Just when I expressed my renewed interest and appreciation of [[Anki\|Anki]], it pulled this stunt on me! :-(

## *(2023-08-10)* Sudden slowdown of desktop on browser and search

This inexplicable degradation happened suddenly today, after I had added TwMoeD (Mandarin) for weeks. I also haven't installed any new add-ons lately.

Incredible... Now it's a long wait to even open the browser. What's more appalling: More than 1 minute for any search! (Used to be 6-7 seconds).

I tried restoring from backup. No joy.
### Emergency remedy

Keep slimming down until the collection isn't oversized:
- The limit seems to be 314.5MB (consistent behavior)

Slim down main profile by moving these decks to ekliao+2:

- Taigi
- MoeD（Mandarin）
- JMYH
- Note-taking
- XSHJHY

After unloading these, the main profile was able to do a full sync (required, after restoring from backup) to AnkiWeb.

Stats:
- Backup size: 124.4MB
- Database (Collection.anki2): 293.5MB < 314.5MB.
#### Beyond repair

After slimming, at least 30 seconds for "front:" search. Too slow still!

At this point, I realized there's no going back to the 6-7 second search. I don't know what happened, but it is what it is.

Luckily, [[AnkiWeb\|AnkiWeb]] search interface is usable, and is blazing fast.

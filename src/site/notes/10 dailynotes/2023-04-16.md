# The Day My Website Went Live!
# 媽，我成功架站啦！

There's always a way. 柳暗花明又一村。

Just as I swore to stop pursuing a solution to publish my Obsidian vault through [[GitHub\|GitHub]] yesterday, having spent half a day wrangling [[Git\|Git]] push, commit, and permission issues that weren't documented by the "handholding" guides on the web, I may have found another ray of hope: [[Web publishing with Obsidian + Github + Netlify\|Obsidian + Github + Netlify]] from a Chinese guy whose video I first stumbled upon on [[Bilibili\|Bilibili]]. Naturally The prior difficulty lowered my expectations.

I gave myself one hour's time top to evaluate whether this solution has legs *(v means a check mark)*:
- v No hassle in dealing with manual git push/commit
- v Easy and reproducible workflow from creating and updating to deploying through [[Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin + Netlify\|Obsidian Digital Garden Plugin + Netlify]]
- v Free or very low cost
- v Must work with [[custom domain name\|custom domain name]]

I can't believe it! In half an hour's time, I successfully published to the world part of my Obsidian vault using the proposed solution, of which Netlify is clearly key, and I managed to give it a proper, though still unconventional, URL: [https://ericliaointerpreting.netlify.app](https://main--ericliaointerpreting.netlify.app). You are looking at it!

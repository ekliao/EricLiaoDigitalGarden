## Quick verdict: 3 stars

I started using this time logging app on Android and later moved to iOS. I upgraded from Basic to the Pro version in 2022. Generally speaking, it's useful, but often the buttons for start/pause/stop don't respond accurately, resulting in continued counting when I had meant for a task to stop. This is a frequent issue.

Adding the Apple Watch to the mix makes the situation worse. The same problem can be observed and I chalk it down as a broader issue of bad design in sync between the cloud and the local apps on iOS and WatchOS.

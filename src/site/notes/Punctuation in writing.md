## Oxford comma

I will always try to use the Oxford comma. To me, it has no downside.

#### Page Comment
- Good and commendable use of the Oxford comma. Two instances in this paragraph.

#### Highlights & Notes

- Perl can’t directly express “something alphabetic” independent of locale, so we have to be more clever. The \\w regular expression notation matches one alphabetic, numeric, or underscore character. Therefore, \\W is not one of those. The negated character class \[^\\W\\d_\] specifies a byte that must not be an alphanumeric, a digit, or an underscore.

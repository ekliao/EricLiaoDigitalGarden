- To my disappointment, [[EasyFind\|EasyFind]] does not reliably find text in files as expected. I tried to look for a simple fixed string such as `disqus` in a directory tree of files and it found fewer files than expected. I have no idea why such a simple search failed. In comparison, the tried-and-true [[Text Editors#^81cbb4\|EmEditor]] (available on Windows only, alas) did fine.

* Turns out, adding [Disqus](https://disqus.com/)-style commenting support to my digital garden wasn't as easy as it seems, by simply putting some universal code snippet (with one change) in a file under the `_include` directory. I hit a snag.

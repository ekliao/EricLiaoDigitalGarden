## Using DEVONThink for Managing and Annotating PDFs â€“ The Sweet Setup

### Highlights & Notes
- Using DEVONThink for Managing and Annotating PDFs
- Craft Notes is still one of my favorite new apps of the last four or five years, but it didnâ€™t end up sticking as well as I thought when the real studying began.  The immediate issue I ran into: PDFs. Craft can house PDFs and quickly reference a PDF inside a block, but you canâ€™t annotate a PDF in Craft. You can open the PDF inside Preview, but any annotations you make in the PDF has to be re-uploaded to Craft.  Overall, Craft was an imperfect solution for reading, marking up, and stuyding 125 PDFs of 30 pages a piece.  I needed to find a different solution in a short period of time in early January, and I settled on DEVONThink.
- Once those documents show up on the iPad, Iâ€™ve found DEVONThink to Go on the iPad to be a pretty reasonable PDF editor.
- But DEVONThink on the Mac has jumped aboard the same backlinking train as Obsidian, Roam, Craft, and other heralded note-taking and research apps. Inside DEVONThink on the Mac, you can have the app provide a link inside a note to every reference of another file inside DEVONThink. Once the setting is turned on, DEVONThink instantaneously creates the link and allows you to jump back and forth between the connection.

Wow. This is a richer set of search operators than DTSearch! I'm instantly sold on the idea of getting it for Mac. #todo Research its file format support, method of indexing (auto or manual), etc.

# Issues

- Auto indexing (https://discourse.devontechnologies.com/t/automatic-indexing/59382)
	- Conflict with other syncing apps

## Using it for dictionary, glossary lookup

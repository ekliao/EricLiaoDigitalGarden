## What do you call the "/" symbol?

# Name That Symbol

</div>



I don't know why some people call `/` the backlash and `\` the forward slash or simply a slash. It's the other way around. [Here's](https://youtube.com/clip/UgkxvaGKB3fEeUYrFxPaosF0vn-jW_o82YaE) an example. ([src](https://youtu.be/ccXkhFufQfw?t=225))

### What does Wikipedia say?
- [Backslash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backslash) (\\)
- [(Forward) slash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forward_slash) (/)

No surprise there.

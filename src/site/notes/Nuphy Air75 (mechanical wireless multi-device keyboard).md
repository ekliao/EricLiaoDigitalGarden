# Verdict: 3/5

*20240330* One more point deducted due to the recent frequent wireless (USB dongle) performance issue. Bluetooth seems fine.

*202403* Would have been 5/5, but I had to deduct one full point due to recent degraded wireless (USB dongle) performance for unknown reasons.

## Settings shortcuts

- Power switch (second one from top right)
	- OFF: right-most position
	- Wired: middle position
	- Wireless (using USB dongle): left-most position

- Win/Mac switch (top right)
	- Mac: left
	- Win: right
	- 🤷 Quirkiness: Ironically, setting it to Mac will enable F3 for 'next hit' after the toggle, but setting it to Win will not work.  ( #todo verify this is still the case)


- Battery level: `FN + \` Green indicates a high/full level (*Beware:* the battery level is shown only when the charging cable is unplugged.)
- Indicator lights (both sides): `FN + / + up/down arrow`
- RGB multicolor lights/glow/flashing: `FN + H (Halo) + up/down arrow`
## For use by the Windows 11 Pro VM
- Use `OPT` (option) key for `ALT` on Windows, naturally
	- e.g. `CTRL-OPT-DEL` to effect the "three-finger salute"
- Use `CTRL` (or sometimes `CTRL-CMD`) to effect the CTRL key on Windows
	- e.g. `CTRL-R` (or `CTRL-CMD-R`) to start OCR on selected pages in FineReader
- Use F1-F12 function keys like normal, e.g. F5 for refresh, F3 for next hit
	- Toggle `FN-TAB-'F'` (the letter 'F')

# Issues

*202403* Soon after I came home from the Taiwan trip and reconnected all the USB hubs including setting up the newly purchased 7-port USB 3.0 to USB Type C adapter, the Nuphy Air75 wireless connection, which used to be fast and smooth, started to become iffy--it was either slow, unstable, or skipping or adding letters. Very annoying. I had to resort to using the wired option (thank goodness it is an option) almost always now. Very disappointed! It's strange this problem coincided with the failure of the old 7-port hub and the addition of the new one.

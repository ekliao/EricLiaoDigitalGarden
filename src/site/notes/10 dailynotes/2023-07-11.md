# Hit Obsidian file limit?

As I experiment with a vault dedicated to dictionaries and reference materials, I seem to have hit a wall. My desktop Obsidian hangs and wouldn't get past loading, when total number of notes is...

384K (after two days of iCloud syncing) - not responsive
378K - same as above; saa
346K - (slowly) loading cache... eventually still stuck

Meanwhile, the iPhone/iPad app loaded but hanged frequently at the 346k level. iOS performance doesn't matter that much. It's the desktop that must have decent performance.

315K - saa
228K - saa
86K - saa

At this point, I am declaring that this vault is damaged beyond repair, because previously I had a vault with 150K that eventually loaded and worked fine. 86K can't be the limit! My initial dump of 384K must have ruined it. Luckily, Obsidian vault management, being local file based, is a piece of cake. It's iCloud that's always the pain.

# Alternative: the gradual approach

I created a new vault, and started adding folders/files gradually...

25K - OK after showing indexing
(Next, a big jump in files because of bigram Chinese entries of almost 90K)
115K - OK. As shown. It worked after it completed indexing, which is always slow and sporadic, but at least an indication of action.

180K - OK
228K - OK
269K - in progress

Almost 300K. A new milestone!

### Don't disturb the indexing

Here's a tip: If a file is found, appears to be opened, but content isn't showing, consider waiting until the indexing is done. Don't wreck it.

While this problem occurred, iCloud is busy too.

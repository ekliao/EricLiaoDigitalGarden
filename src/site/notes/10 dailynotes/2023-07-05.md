# Learning Obsidian's Excalibrain plugin

At first blush, it is better than the generic graph view in that it has automatic notions of parents, children, and siblings. I am glad it automatically determined that my home page is the parent of "Latest Blogposts" and many published daily notes are naturally its children, as the unfiltered default Excalibrain graph shows. Neat!

# Obsidian plugin - Excalidraw

</div>



I installed this only because it is required for [Excalibrain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rk3K4mlgOMM&list=PL6mqgtMZ4NP3dJlJLxqVm1rd3y-lWklLu) (officially available as a plugin), but what its creator [Zsolt](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=o2BD73hbUWk) reveals may imprint Excalidraw on the top of my mind: PDF freehand highlighting. Wonderful! None of that "straight-line highlighting/underlining and typed-text commenting" kind of "rÃ¨glo" nonsense ðŸ˜‚ Ã  la [[Obsidian plugin - Annotator (PDF)\|Obsidian plugin - Annotator (PDF)]].

As shown, I can't wait to get my hands dirty in marking up a PDF page with highlighters any way I want!

# Desideratum

From the thread below, it seems Zotero doesn't support freehand drawing on a PDF page. Too bad! BTW they call this "inking." See:

#### Highlights & Notes
- PDF Annotation: Inking bwiernik March 10, 2021 I read a lot statistics PDFs. As I do, I like to write with a stylus on the page. For example, I will write alternative forms of an equation in the margins or write out steps of proofs that aren’t clear. I also like to circle parts of equations that are most relevant (the highlight tool often does a poor job of this). I would really like if Zotero’s new PDF reader could support the ink annotation tool for these purposes, especially as part the iPad app.

- This college teacher attributes high student scores to use of Zotero
- It's not the best PDF annotation tool on the iPad, but the best for storing research data.

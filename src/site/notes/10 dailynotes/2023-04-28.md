- Woke up with an alarming [sore throat](https://fortune.com/well/2022/12/19/why-do-you-have-a-sore-throat-when-you-wake-up-in-the-morning-its-not-always-covid-or-flu/), which was gone two hours later. This is new to me.

- I helped my mom and dad [Enable FaceTime calling on the Apple Watch](https://youtu.be/NLPQ-Vo0myQTime https://youtu.be/NLPQ-Vo0myQaudio calling on the Apple Watch](https://youtu.be/NLPQ-Vo0myQ) and had them try it on each other. It worked beautifully.

When the iPhone is in the range of the Apple Watch, one can start a Facetime audio call to another using the Watch only. The sound is clear enough for a brief call.

Soon later, I tried this with RP in the US (I'm in Taiwan for the moment) but it failed. I was able to initiate the FaceTime audio call using my Watch, but I was forced to talk using the iPhone's microphone; the Watch's face was confusing as to whether the call has been started. This entirely different experience using the same Apple products and supposedly the same method is rather frustrating.

A Hong Kong Chinese blogger about English dictionaries and grammar whose views I often dismiss as too dogmatic points out how the first syllable of `occasion` being only /@/, not ever /O/ or /oU/. I occasionally do /oU/ and thought it a systematic option. Before I chalked this off as yet another uninformed post, I looked it up and it turns out I was wrong. None of the reputable English-to-English dictionaries (about 10+ of them) list /oU/ as an alternative. Well, this is perhaps the reason I have not unfollowed him.

Completionism, or completism（求全主義）: I clearly suffer from this “mental disorder,” judging by my weeklong obsession with turning all of my paid Rocket French Level 1 materials into Anki flashcards.

Time has been spent, and there's no getting it back. At least I am comforted by the notion that the mere act of manually creating flashcards reinforces some learning from the materials, as confirmed by [LanguageJones](https://www.youtube.com/clip/Ugkx3TEFg-njcnWL2PyPRmOFEV_TuCYr1w45).

### Highlights & Notes

- Using Obsidian as a full blown language zettelkasten (if I may call it that)?  
- I have set aside a specialized vault that I intend to use as a sort of dictionary. Of course, words by themselves are not terribly useful, it won’t be a mere collection of words but a collection of sentences, phrases and idioms, etc… all properly explained in my own words and interlinked. I want to combine this with sentence mining.

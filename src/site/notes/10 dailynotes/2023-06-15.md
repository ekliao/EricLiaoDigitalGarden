# AutoSleep (iOS app)

![[../_attachments/IMG_D84FFD7A5E56-1.jpeg\|300]]

I have used this app for three years now, since June 2020. I use it to track sleep every day, in combination with the Apple Watch. At first, I loved it. The way it shows sleep time (as shown) is cool. But soon I found its biggest flaw in software development, hence the 2-star review.

# Verdict: 2 stars
- There's always a lag of several minutes in showing the sleep time, resulting in inconsistent and erroneous handling resulting from the user's manual edit/override (seeing that the last portion of sleep isn't shown as sleep) and the app's catching up post-user-override, which overrides the user-override, negating it in effect, to erroneous tracking, if you get my drift. This user has gotten into the habit of double-checking 5 minutes later to undo the error—every—darn—time!
- Expected result: no software product should unilaterally change and undo the user's override without alerting the user. This behavior is extremely annoying, feeling like betrayal.

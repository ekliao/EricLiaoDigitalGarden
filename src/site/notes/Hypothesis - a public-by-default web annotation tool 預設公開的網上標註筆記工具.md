A flexible online highlighting, note-taking, and sharing app. What sets it apart from [[Omnivore - an open-source, free Readwise Reader alternative 免費的閱讀筆記書籤軟體\|Omnivore]] and [[Glasp\|Glasp]] is that you get to control each note's visibility: by default all notes are public and published, but you can make a note private, viewable to you only by creating it in a private group or setting it to "to me only" in a (default) public group. I tested this and it really works as claimed. Anyone can read and search for a public note without a Hypothesis account. 

Hypothesis doesn't compete head on with [[Omnivore - an open-source, free Readwise Reader alternative 免費的閱讀筆記書籤軟體\|Omnivore]] because it isn't also a reading app, but it kind of eats [[Glasp\|Glasp]]'s lunch, in my opinion, simply by having a functioning [[Obsidian plugin - Hypothesis\|Obsidian plugin - Hypothesis]] that syncs to Obsidian, like Omnivore does.

This tool seems rather popular with teachers and students because it integrates with learning management platforms like [[Canvas\|Canvas]].

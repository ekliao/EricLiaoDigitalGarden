It's a rare find of a tool (excluding programming languages) that understands `\p{Han}`, identifying Chinese characters, in regex.

能用`\p{Han}`辨出中文的正規表式工具（不計程式語言）如鳳毛麟角：

- [[EmEditor\|EmEditor]] (Windows only, has a free mode)
- [[CotEditor\|CotEditor]] (Mac, free)
- [[BBEdit\|BBEdit]] (Mac, has a free mode)

Anything else?

還有嗎？

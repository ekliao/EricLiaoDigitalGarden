Paid $30 to buy it some three years ago in order to even be able to try it. Played with it for a day or two. Found the file size it produced prohibitively gigantic (think 2G bytes for a 300MB scanned PDF file). Now it's deservedly neglected, lying somewhere on my large old iPad taking up its precious storage. Should I give it another chance now with my new understanding of PKM?

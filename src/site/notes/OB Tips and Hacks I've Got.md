# Copying and pasting tabular data into Obsidian

What a delight! In researching a term ("oxycodone"), I selected partial tabular data from a web page and copy-and-pasted into Obsidian, expecting to do some manual tweaking, but look at this table:

## Post-editing
What's left for me to do is edit and add one vertical bar to fix the alignment problem, and voil√†! It's as good as it gets. The visual elements (pictures) are nicely dealt with as linked images.

- In the file pane, drag a file/note into the editor pane to get a link to its name (`![[file-name]]` and then remove the link
	  e.g. for copying the PDF file name into the required `annotation-target:` frontmatter field in order to use the `Annotator` plugin to annotate the PDF in OB.

- Using right-nav-pane Tag Wrangler plugin (#) to rename a tag globally including making it nested! Powerful

- [nested tags](https://help.obsidian.md/Editing+and+formatting/Tags#Nested+tags) (/)
- [embedding a note](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Embedding+files), or a [heading](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+heading+in+a+note) or a [block](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links#Link+to+a+block+in+a+note) of a note (! followed by usual double square-brackets), or embedding internal files (different formats) in general
	- Advantage: avoiding content duplication. *Write once, reference anywhere.*
		- Application: write something in a daily note and refer to it through embedding, because daily notes have the feel of chronologically documenting living, discovery, learning, and progress.
- [alias](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Aliases) (front-matter) for effecting bilingual or multilingual notes, or translation of a source-language note
- [linking to another vault](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/is-there-a-way-to-quickly-link-to-another-vault/20652) `[text](obsidian://vault/<name-of-vault>)` instead of https://
	- Or to a note: `[text](obsidian://vault/<name-of-vault>/<name-of-note-w-space-written-as-%20>)`
- block reference (>)
- swapping line up and down (cmd+1, cmd+2)
- Folding/unfolding (cmd+3)

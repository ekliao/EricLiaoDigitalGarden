Just as I sworn to stop pursuing a solution to publish my Obsidian vault through [[programming/GitHub\|Github]] yesterday, having spent half a day wrangling [[Git\|Git]] push, commit, and permission issues that weren't documented by the "handholding" guides on the web, I may have found another ray of hope: [[Web publishing with Obsidian + Github + Netlify\|Obsidian + Github + Netlify]] from a Chinese guy whose video I first stumbled upon on [[Bilibili\|Bilibili]]. Naturally The prior difficulty lowered my expectations.

I gave myself one hour's time top to evaluate whether this solution has legs *(v means a check mark)*:
- v No hassle in dealing with manual git push/commit
- v Easy and reproducible workflow from creating and updating to deploying through [[Digital Garden Plugin + Netlify\|Digital Garden Plugin + Netlify]]
- v Free or very low cost
- #todo Must work with [[custom domain name\|custom domain name]]

I can't believe it! In half an hours' time, I successfully published to the world part of my Obsidian vault using the proposed solution, part of which Netlify is clearly key, and managed to give it a proper, though still unconventional, URL: [https://ericliaointerpreting.netlify.app](https://main--ericliaointerpreting.netlify.app). You are looking at it!

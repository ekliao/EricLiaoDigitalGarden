# Eric Liao Interpreting

## About Me

My name is Eric Liao and I go by Eric. I am a freelance ***conference interpreter*** and ***court interpreter*** based in the San Francisco Bay Area, United States. I am originally from Taipei, Taiwan. 

Here's my CV/résumé in [PDF](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1x2w2NirxGCWH6FfUQIGFDNAa1wWMs3oS/view?usp=sharing) or [Word doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PSfvw_oGpZYrjDhLmePZDfkx-2DQbcLdtMUTyIZMV40/edit?usp=sharing) *(last updated: Jan 16, 2023)*. I interpret between ***Mandarin Chinese*** *(native)* and ***English*** *(near-native)*, and also from *[Tâigí](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwanese_Hokkien)*.

## Welcome! 

Welcome to my digital garden! It's a collection of notes in various stages of maturity and polish, open to the world, FWIW. Created April 16, 2023, it is still nascent but an exciting start. 千里之行，始於足下。 A journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.

To put this website in context, [Andy Matuschak's insight](https://notes.andymatuschak.org/About_these_notes?stackedNotes=z21cgR9K3UcQ5a7yPsj2RUim3oM2TzdBByZu&stackedNotes=z4bK6LaSBRetDzuYkeCs3A8mJ8DufTbK4o6FS) about thinking and writing notes for the self, disregarding the audience resonates with how I feel all along when blogging became a thing in the early 2000s. What he says about *working with the garage door up* and *anti-marketing*, word!

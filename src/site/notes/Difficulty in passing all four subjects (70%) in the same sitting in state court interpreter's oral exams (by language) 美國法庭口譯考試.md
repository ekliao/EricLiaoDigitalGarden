I vaguely remember seeing this table once before. Now it has resurfaced, thanks to a classmate.

Amazing that Mandarin, difficult as it is for simultaneous, isn't the most difficult language.

For states such as California that require a test-taker to pass all four subjects (sight counts as two subjects) in the same sitting, the simultaneous section clearly is the ~~bottleneck~~ chokehold for many, debunking the false common perception of a 20% pass rate for Spanish or even Mandarin.

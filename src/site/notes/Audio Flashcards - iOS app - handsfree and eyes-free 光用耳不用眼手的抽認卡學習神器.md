I chanced upon this gem of an app two weeks ago. A day later, having had only a cursory impression of its features and limits, I contacted the developer giving him praise but not letting him off easy:

#paste/email
I found your iOS app for audio flashcards. The handsfree nature of the design is something Iâ€™ve been searching for for a long time. I am glad I found it. But I do have some questions: does the app support bulk import and export of audio fronts and backs in audio file formats (for example .mp3)? Entry one by one is time-consuming. I already have tons of such audio cards in Anki, but Anki doesnâ€™t have your appâ€™s handsfree configuration. I hope I can leverage the best of both worlds by importing existing Anki decks into your app for handsfree practice.  
  
If the app does not yet support bulk imports of audio files, I really hope youâ€™ll consider adding this feature. I am sure many users will welcome it and find it extremely useful. If you add this feature, people will pay a fee to use it!

The developer responded almost immediately:

Iâ€™m glad youâ€™re enjoying the app. At the moment you can only import individual audio files to a card. Have you just using the Anki iOS app to create cards?

My follow-up response:

Thanks for the quick response. I have used Anki for years and learned how to bulk import audio cards (or text + audio mixed cards) into Anki through a text file or a spreadsheet (in tab-separated value or comma-separated value) easily. Anki recognizes this format for an embedded audio media file in running text, e.g.:  `[sound:abc.m4a]`
  
Several formats are supported: mp3, m4a, etc. The key is being able to bulk import many cards at once through some mechanism. That'll be extremely useful and efficient. I don't know if this answered your question. Let me know if you need me to clarify anything.

# Quick verdict: 4 stars
## Pros

- Handsfree, eyes-free
- Free of charge
- ASR to make searching by text possible (awesome!)
- Auto detection of languages: English and Mandarin!
- Thoughtful configuration of audio playback during review to suit personal needs
## Cons

- No bulk imports of audio yet
- UI of editing/trimming of each recorded clip is a bit awkward and counter-intuitive
- No bulk exports of audio cards that one has painstakingly made (though I found a backdoor and learned how to bulk export; method not idea; still takes some programming)

## A useful review

Great minds think alike? ðŸ˜† This user had asked for the same thing: bulk importing.

#### Good tool for learning languages

> Itâ€™s really been handy the only down side Iâ€™ve run into it the lack of a way toÂ **automate uploading audio files**. MaybeÂ **Apple shortcuts**Â support would be nice.

Developer Response:

> Thank you for your review.Â **I am interested to hear your opinion, contact me to discuss this feature request.**

#### Glad this exists butâ€¦

> First, when I was thinking this would be a great way to prep for stuff, I was surprised that there werenâ€™t more options and, at the same time, very glad there was this app which had most of what I wanted. While I wish I could type in or import stuff so that a generated voice could read it, the fact that it will play both the prompt and the answer with a definable pause as well as continue playing without any user interaction makes it perfect for use while driving. I also appreciate the ability to make edits even if itâ€™s basically re-recording then trimming/deleting the first version. In addition, I like being able to have nested folders that all play if the parent is chosen for review. The biggest downside to this app is lack of documentation (new explanations for some things but could use more) and behavior (why does it think Iâ€™m done reviewing for the day after one pass through and which of the other methods will mimic normal review?). It would be great to just keep the whole stack on repeat with a random order; perhaps, using the microphone, it could be set to determine if you gave the wrong answer and prioritize those.Â **Iâ€™d also like the ability to review with the screen off and/or in the background while doing other stuff on my device.**Â Finally, while I appreciate the fact that it can be used hands free, you can also hold it and mark your successes and failures.Â **Unfortunately, if you mark a success before the playback is complete (or mostly), itâ€™ll count it as skipped**Â then going back takes a little more effort than youâ€™d think plus you still have to listen again rather than simply marking it as complete. Basically, that mode is more frustrating than it is useful (donâ€™t think it maintains stats). All in all, glad to have this app and glad itâ€™s free.

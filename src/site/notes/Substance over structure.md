#note-taking 
Musings on note-taking on this digital garden:

I should make the writing more organic and atomic Ã  la Matuschak Evergreen Notes and less top-down organizational and taxonomic or with too much enumerating. The latter tendencies are perhaps out of an innate predilection for order and neatness, or even OCD, but I can feel they will end up obstructing thinking rather than foster it. Let thought run free and be expressed freely in notes scattered about, and links and backlinks will take care of connecting them.

For example, forget about neatly creating hierarchical notes named

`dictionaries` > `AHD5`

just so that I can write about a seemingly quirky intransitive sense for `discuss` in AHD5. Rather, just write about the substantive issue of `absolute verbs` and connect it to `grammar`, and stop caring about whether `dictionaries` or `AHD5` exist or how and where they should fit in.

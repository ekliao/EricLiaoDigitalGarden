# The gravitational pull of Logseq


## Markmap plugin

Thanks to [Dario da Silva](https://www.logseqmastery.com/)'s free YouTube introductory videos for demonstrating this wonderful visualization of the hierarchical nature of Logseq as a terrific outliner.

In just three days, my learning and using of Logseq accelerated. Look at this chart for just today. It's mainly notes I took from watching PKM videos. Very meta. I positively love it!

## Long-form writing

The very last video I just watched is about a hack of promoting long-form writing in Logseq, which I consider to be yet lacking in LQ without native support. I am kind of sold on the idea of using the focus mode plugin plus the built-in document mode as illustrated in the video. With that, I think the barrier for long-form is largely removed, leaving me with pure admiration of LQ's block-based approach, which is turning out to be more granular and structured than page-based, and is way more conducive to future enhancement of LQ as a database app like Tana and notion. This development is very unlikely for Obsidian. That said, I am feeling a strong gravitational pull toward LQ as the go-to note-taking app for everything, even including long-form writing. 

## Todo

#todo What I have yet to do:
- Study the page markdown files more closely.
- Learn about publishing pages from LQ. This may turn out to be crucial if not a dealbreaker.

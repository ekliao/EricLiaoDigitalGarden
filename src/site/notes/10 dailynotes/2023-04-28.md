- I helped my mom and dad [Enable FaceTime calling on the Apple Watch](https://youtu.be/NLPQ-Vo0myQTime https://youtu.be/NLPQ-Vo0myQaudio calling on the Apple Watch](https://youtu.be/NLPQ-Vo0myQ) and had them try it on each other. It worked beautifully.
When the iPhone is in the range of the Apple Watch, one can start a Facetime audio call to another using the Watch only. The sound is clear enough for a brief call.
- Soon later, I tried this with RP in the US (I'm in Taiwan for the moment) but it failed. I was able to initiate the FaceTime audio call using my Watch, but I was forced to talk using the iPhone's microphone; the Watch's face was confusing as to whether the call has been started. This entirely different experience using the same Apple products and supposedly the same method is rather frustrating.

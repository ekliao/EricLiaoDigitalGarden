This is tantalizing. 要命的賣關子！ I think this means that some form of publishing of Tana is possible, in the way of Notion. (I haven't tried Notion publish. Only heard of it.)

My only concern is whether it'll jack up the estimated price of future subscription from the already not-inexpensive $100/year. 
## In terms of long-term storage/retrieval (of videos), what is upload limit/file and total storage? Are we better off linking externally, e.g. a Dropbox link to the video?

#answer/authority/quote
It should be enough for all reasonable usage, and we will keep increasing it - we are working towards the idea that not only should you be able to store all of your personal information, but big teams should be able to collaborate on complex knowledge bases, so storage limitations/speed etc should not be holding people back.

## If not using direct video uploads for embedding, what external video links will work as embedded thumbnails?

A: I'd recommend using YouTube. Embedding works  like a charm, just post the link and it comes up straight away. Even "unlisted" YouTube videos work.
## Can I use regex search on field values?

A: No.

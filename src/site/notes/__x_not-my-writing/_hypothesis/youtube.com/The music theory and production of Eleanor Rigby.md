harmonically this is pretty straightforward we're in the key of E minor right now and I've got the e natural minor scale loaded up on the accordion

### Annotation
So excited to see aQWERTYon allows you to set to a key and a major/minor tonality, in this case E minor. This means the base note (bottom-left, Z) is E as the tonic of the E minor. This allows for both fixed do naming of actual notes (without needing to hear the nice music transposed) and at the same time analyze the music and chords FUNCTIONALLY (in the movable do sense). Truly the best of both worlds!

so far in the tune all of the chord changes have happened on down beats

downbeat: 每一小節（這裡是四四拍）的第一拍
## Quote
that one all of a sudden instead of falling on the downbeat falls on beat three right in the middle of the bar

### Annotation
（四四拍小節）第三拍：不能稱爲 downbeat（只能指第一拍），這是「次強拍」。
## Quote
so so far the whole tune has been an unnatural minor but in that verse Paul McCartney switches from a natural minor to e Dorian mode and the two scales are a little bit different so here's a Dorian mode it's identical to E natural minor except for this this sixth scale degree so an e natural minor it's C natural you need Dorian it's C sharp and that's a subtle change but it does change the mood quite a bit

mode 調式

Dorian 多利安調式，最接近 Aeolian/自然小調，但是較不全盤悲傷憂鬱，因為有那一個突出的升高半音的第六音。

想想 Scarborough Fair 的第二個樂句，本來以爲是自然小調，但聽到 35653#423 -> 應換成多利安來思考，於是變成 61216756 （不再有臨時升降記號）。全曲應該改成多利安調式的思考：第一樂句於是從自然小調 663337176 變成 226663432。很妙吧！

suddenly sounds like we're in the Renaissance yeah Dorian mode is something that you well you think of it as being like a jazz thing but in classical music it's something that kind of predates the major/minor system it's something you think of more as belonging to like the Renaissance like Greensleeves is in Dorian mode

調式 modes 比現代的大小調系統起源更早！

文藝復興 古典音樂

不是爵士樂的專利
## Quote
I choose to think of it as the pre-chorus now typically the pre-chorus comes after the verse and before the chorus here there is no chorus that follows it it just goes straight into verse two but that's not totally unheard of in pop music and rock and things like that and the next time the pre-chorus happens it does lead into the chorus so I justify that

### Annotation
pre-chorus 前副歌

通常銜接副歌，但此處第一次出現後，又立即回到主歌。這在流行曲和搖滾樂並不少見。
## Quote
first half of this phrase it's it's got this a Dorian feeling because the baseline walks down from D to C sharp and then it goes to C natural and then to be and that descending chromatic line so it implies a shift from Dorian to natural minor and also just descending chromaticism is always sad which i think is why Paul chose it

### Annotation
nice analysis! 好棒的觀察和分析
1 漸降半音走勢：悲傷
2 同時顯示，和諧從多利安轉回自然小調
## Quote
the underlying scale is kind of natural minor [Music] but he doesn't exactly see that he kind of sings that B flat and that B flat is not part of the natural minor scale it's really he's really a voguing the blues scale the e blues scale and that's an extremely cool thing to do because this song so far has kind of sounded like classical music but they do not they don't do that in classical music that is very much an african-american thing very cool stuff

哇，aQWERTYon 不僅可以載入大小調，還能設定成其他調性，例如藍調 blues scale！太厲害了，非常有用，這裡根本就現成拿來展示了。

藍調不用於古典樂，而是有非洲黑人靈魂風

now we are all used to the sound of clothes miked instruments like it's become a standard studio technique especially in rock but it would have sounded very very strange to people at the time

有了比較，體會往往更深！

關於「聽出和弦」這個活動（我可說一輩子都試圖在鍛鍊這個能力！）：

關於Eleanor Rigby的和弦分析，我是先看了另一位老師Aimee Nolte的「聽出和弦」影片：
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imj7FniRzyY

然後再來到Ethan老師這裡。兩位的手法非常不同，看完都各有收穫。

Short for "[regular expressions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)." "RegExp" is another common abbreviation. In Chinese, Ê≠£Ë¶èË°®Á§∫Âºè, which I prefer to shorten as Ê≠£Ë¶èË°®Âºè.

## Perl and regex: a match made in heaven

I am not exaggerating if I say that my career as a localization engineer (2002‚Äì2020) was launched entirely by my fascination with and my eventual self-taught expertise in [Perl](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/) and regex. 

## Perl 6, regexes, and grammars: nirvana

- Book: üî• [Parsing With Perl 6 Regexes and Grammars](https://www.amazon.com/Parsing-Perl-Regexes-Grammars-Recursive/dp/1484232275) 

## Unicode
- [Scripts, blocks, etc.](https://www.regular-expressions.info/unicode.html)
- [[Unicode properties for quoting or enclosing characters\|Unicode properties for quoting or enclosing characters]]

The Unicode property shorthand ``\p{Han}`` is a great discovery about regex. So glad that [[CotEditor\|CotEditor]] on [[MacOS\|MacOS]] supports it, so does [[EmEditor\|EmEditor]] ([[Windows\|Windows]] only).

## People
- [Jeffrey Friedl](http://regex.info/) wrote the seminal book on regex: *Mastering Regular Expressions*.
- [Jan Goyvaerts](https://www.just-great-software.com/aboutjg.html) maintains [this](https://www.regular-expressions.info/) great educational site. He makes such esoteric topic as [Regex lookarounds](https://www.regular-expressions.info/lookaround.html) palatable.

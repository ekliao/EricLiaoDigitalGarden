Yesterday, I read this LinkedIn post by [Ilhem Bezzaoucha](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ilhem-bezzaoucha-a4227312b/) about a new "mode" of interpreting, which she called ghost interpreting, and I thought to myself: Ah, the day has finally come when human interpreters are hired only to take a backseat to the main star interpreter in a meeting—AI churning out either speech translation or adding the gimmicky yet cognitively-dissonant hugely-delayed AI generated voice of said translation.

Just one day later, I saw another interpreter mention this as an actual job offer in a group chat. In my paraphrase, an agency is seeking a human interpreter who will provide consecutive interpretation or clarify when and only when the AI voice-to-text translation or voice-to-voice interpretation makes meaning errors or is unclear.
The interpreter asks for suggestions as to how much to charge for this mode of work and perhaps facetiously how much "fun" there might be doing it.

Ilhem's post describes the job this way:
```
Some of us are being asked not to interpret—but to correct. To sit behind machine-generated output and “step in” when the AI falters.
```
In short, the time has come when human interpreters must either accept a job as machine's assistant or monitor or face the reality of dwindling opportunities as the main interpreter. This is bound to become the prevalent mode of interpreting, much like how translators must do post-editing for machine translation (PEMT) at a fraction of cost for years in order to survive.

Ilhem urges interpreters not to be "accomplices" to effect our own "eventual" obsolescence with this somber graphic:

To me, resistance seems futile. Those of us who are doing better in the field may play the last holdouts for a while but once  AI interpreting with human assistance reaches critical mass, everyone has to fend for themselves. It's join the enemy if you can't fight it or be out, and be out of income.

This is of course yet another nail in the coffin for us human interpreters. We can lament and commiserate all we want, but ultimately market forces and capitalism dictate, and agencies, driven by maximization of profits and survival at the minimum (they face fierce competition too), will deliver this inevitable and gloomy outcome.

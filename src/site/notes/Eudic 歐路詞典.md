This is a meta-dictionary app and my no. 1 go-to tool for all read-only dictionaries and other language reference materials for English, Chinese, [[Taigi\|Taigi]], and occasionally French.
## Desiderata

- I use it on my iOS devices, where each installation is free of charge after the onetime payment, but is unfortunately a separate instance (with a different collection of dictionaries and configuration) because the app isn't the "install once and sync everywhere" kind.

- The desktop version also requires a separate purchase, albeit still inexpensive. I really wish there were sync capability across all devices.
